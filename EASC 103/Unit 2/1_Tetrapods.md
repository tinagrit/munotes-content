Lecture 6

## Tetrapods
- are any [[1_Classification#Animal groups|Vertebrate]] that has **4 limbs**
	- including **all descendants**, even if they don't have 4 limbs, e.g. snakes
	- due to clades being [[1_Classification#Cladogram|monophyletic]]
- fishes aren't tetrapods, but the first tetrapods are a **transitional group** of fishes

## Fish evolution
- the 4 cm, fish-like **chordates** evolved with a flexible **notochord**, a precursor to a vertebral column
	- the chordates are **ancestral** to all fishes

- fish **diversify** in the Early [[2_Geologic Time#The Paleozoic Era|Paleozoic]]
- the [[2_Geologic Time#Time Scale|Devonian]] is where fish were **most diverse**, called the "*Age of Fishes*"
- groups including:
	- [[#Jawless fish]] (e.g. *Pacific Lamprey*)
	- Placoderms (e.g. *Dunkleosteus*)
	- Cartilaginous fishes (e.g. *Sharks*)
	- Spiny sharks
	- Ray-finned fish (most diverse fish today)
	- [[#Lobe-finned fish]]

### Jawless fish
- have a **ring of teeth**
- first fishes to appear from the Early [[2_Geologic Time#The Paleozoic Era|Cambrian]]
- still **exists today**, e.g. the Pacific Sea Lamprey
	- **parasitic**, attaching themselves to other fish to feed on blood and tissues

### Lobe-finned fish
- have chunky, **articulated bones** in their fins
	- they can **walk** along the river bed
	- can **travel overland** to other water during drought
- evolved gills and lungs
- aren't exactly tetrapods, the fins **are not** true limbs
