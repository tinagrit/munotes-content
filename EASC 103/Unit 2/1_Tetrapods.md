Lecture 6

## Tetrapods
- are any [[1_Classification#Animal groups|Vertebrate]] that has **4 limbs**
	- including **all descendants**, even if they don't have 4 limbs, e.g. snakes
	- due to clades being [[1_Classification#Cladogram|monophyletic]]
- fishes aren't tetrapods, but the first tetrapods are a **transitional group** of fishes

## Fish evolution
- the 4 cm, fish-like **chordates** evolved with a flexible **notochord**, a precursor to a vertebral column
	- the chordates are **ancestral** to all fishes

- fish **diversify** in the Early [[2_Geologic Time#The Paleozoic Era|Paleozoic]]
- the [[2_Geologic Time#Time Scale|Devonian]] is where fish were **most diverse**, called the "*Age of Fishes*"
- groups including:
	- [[#Jawless fish]] (e.g. *Pacific Lamprey*)
	- Placoderms (e.g. *Dunkleosteus*)
	- Cartilaginous fishes (e.g. *Sharks*)
	- Spiny sharks
	- Ray-finned fish (most diverse fish today)
	- [[#Lobe-finned fish]]

### Jawless fish
- have a **ring of teeth**
- first fishes to appear from the Early [[2_Geologic Time#The Paleozoic Era|Cambrian]]
- still **exists today**, e.g. the Pacific Sea Lamprey
	- **parasitic**, attaching themselves to other fish to feed on blood and tissues

### Lobe-finned fish
- have chunky, **articulated bones** in their fins
	- they can **walk** along the river bed
	- can **travel overland** to other water during drought
- evolved gills and lungs
- aren't exactly tetrapods, the fins **are not** true limbs

> [!tip] Note
> The **Tiktaalik** lobe-finned fish is the **transitional specie** that evolves the **Amphibians**, the first tetrapod with 4 true limbs.

## Amniotes
- are any [[#Tetrapods]] that reproduce via an **enclosed amniotic egg**
- evolved from **amphibian ancestors**
- give rise to the **early reptiles**
	- skeletal modification to **move on land**
	- **enclosed eggs** that survive on dried land, unlike amphibians who lay egg mass in water

Amniotes are categorized into:
- **synapsids**
- **sauropsids** (*most of which are* **diapsids**)

![[graph3.png|600]]

### Synapsids
- have **1 temporal fenestra** low down behind each eye orbit
- the **Dimetrodon** is an example of an early synapsid
- includes the **therapsids** (*mammal-like reptiles*)
- the mammal branches include:
	- **monotreme** - platypus, echidna
	- **marsupials** - kangaroo, koala, wombat
	- **placentals** - human

![[graph8.png|600]]

### Non-Diapsid Sauropsids
- [[#Amniotes|Amniotes]] more closely related to modern **reptiles** than to mammals
- examples include large marine reptiles and turtles

### Diapsid Sauropsids
- have **2 temporal fenestra** behind each eye orbit
- are categorized into **archosaurs** and **lepidosaurs**.
	- **[[#Archosaurs|Archosaurs]]**: semi- to fully upright postures
	- **Lepidosaurs**: sprawling postures, e.g. snakes, lizards

#### Archosaurs
- have semi- to fully upright postures, are categorized into:
	- **Pseudosuchia** - the **semi**-upright - crocodlian line
	- **Avemetatarsalia** - the **fully** upright - [[2_Skeletal Anatomy#Pterosaurs|pterosaurs]] and dinosaurs
- **ankle** modification that allowed for these postures
