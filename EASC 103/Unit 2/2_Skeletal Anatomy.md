## Orientation
- **dorsal** - *back* side
	- if we look at the dinosaur from **top down**, we'd be looking at its dorsal side
- **ventral** - *belly* side
	- if we lay below and **look up** to the dinosaur, we'd be looking at its ventral side
- **anterior** - towards the *front*
- **posterior** - towards the *back*

## The Vertebrae
- **cervical** vertebrae is the neck
- **dorsal** vertebrae is the back
- **sacral** vertebrae is the hip
- **caudal** vertebrae is the tail

## The Skull
See more [[1_Classification#The Skull|Skull]]

> [!tip] Note
> **Fenestra** means an opening in the skull

- the **cranium** (top part of the skull):
	- **maxilla** and **premaxilla** hold the teeth
	- the **nostril** and **nasal** are above the maxilla
	- the **antorbital** fenestra (*unique to the* [[1_Tetrapods#Archosaurs|Archosaurs]]) is next to the **orbit** (eye opening)
	- the two **temporal fenestra**
- the **mandible** (bottom part of the skull):
	- **dentary** holds the teeth
	- in ornithischians, the toothless **predentary**
	- the **mandibular fenestra**, **angular**, and **surangular** are behind the dentary

### Sclerotic rings
- **rarely preserved**, but seen in many vertebrates (not in mammals or crocodilians)
- support the eye

![[chart16.png|450]]


## The Abdomen
- the **rips** protect the abdomen
	- **cervical ribs** are located underneath the cervical vertebrae
	- **dorsal ribs** are located underneath the dorsal vertebrae
- the **gastralia** is located at the base of the belly; they **aren't connected** to other bones
	- ***gastro*** = related to stomach

![[chart9.png|450]]


## The fore limb
- **scapula** is the shoulder
- **coracoid** is below the scapula
	- only amongst the [[1_Classification#Theropods|theropods]], there exists the **furcula** between the left and right coracoid (not seen in side view)
- **humerus** is the upper arm bone
- the lower arm bones:
	- **radius** is the inside
	- **ulna** is the outside

![[chart10.png|450]]

- the **manus** (hand)
	- **carpal** is the wrist
	- **metacarpal** is the palm
	- **phalanges** are the fingers
	- **ungual** is the terminal phalanx that is a sharp claw or a flattered hoof

> [!note] Note
>  Since the *T-rex* manus is small, parts of the manus are labelled on the *Tawa*, a theropod

![[chart11.png|450]]


## The Pelvis
See more [[1_Classification#The Pelvis|Pelvis]]
- **ilium** is located on the upper part of the pelvis
- **pubis** points forward in a [[1_Classification#The Pelvis|saurischian]], backward in an [[1_Classification#The Pelvis|ornithischian]]
- **ischium** points backward

![[chart12.png|450]]


## The hind limb
- **femur** is the upper leg bone, connected to the **hip socket** at the ilium
- the lower leg bones:
	- **tibia** is the inside
	- **fibula** is the outside
- the **pes** (foot)
	- **tarsal** is the ankle
	- **metatarsal** is the sole
	- **phalanges** are the fingers
	- **ungual** is the terminal phalanx that is a sharp claw or a flattered hoof****

![[chart13.png|450]]


## The Tail
See more [[1_Classification#The Tail Vertebrae|Tail vertebrae]]
- **centrum** is the centre piece bone
- **chevron** is the v-shaped boned extending below the tail's vertebrae protecting blood vessels and providing muscle attachment points in the tail
- the **neural spines** go above the centrum

![[chart14.png|450]]

## Pterosaurs
- the "*winged lizards*", an [[1_Tetrapods#Archosaurs|Avemetatarsalian Archosaur]]
	- sister clade to the dinosaurs, **aren't dinosaurs**
	- existed from the [[2_Geologic Time#Triassic Period|Late Triassic]] to the end of [[2_Geologic Time#Cretaceous Period|Cretaceous]] (228-66 Ma)
- has **odd body dimensions** and adaptation for **powered flight**
	- short torso
	- hollow bones
	- wings composed of skin membranes
	- large membrane supposed by a **really long [[4_Tracks#Toes|digit IV]]**

![[chart17 1.png|650]]


### Pterosaur Examples
- the **Pteranodon longiceps**
	- "*winged, toothless, long-headed*"
	- lived in North America 85 Ma
	- wingspan **over 6 metres**
- the **Azhdarchid**
	- some of the largest pterosaurs to exist
	- lived at the end of [[2_Geologic Time#Cretaceous Period|Cretaceous]] in North America
	- wingspan **over 11 metres**
