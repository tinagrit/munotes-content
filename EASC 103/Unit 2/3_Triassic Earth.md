See overview [[2_Geologic Time#Triassic Period|Triassic Period]]

## The Supercontinent
- all Earth's continental **crust assembled** in the [[2_Geologic Time#The Paleozoic Era|Late Paleozoic]]
- "one big landmass" called **Pangea
	- Pan (all, across)
	- Gaia (Mother Earth, land)

### Tectonic plates
- **lithosphere** refers to the Earth's crust and the upper mantle
- it is broken into many fragments called **lithospheric plates** (*tectonic plates*)
- theses plate **move**, due to the **convection** of the rocks underneath the crust (*asthenosphere*)
	- the **convection current** moves ductile rocks around

![[chart18.png|350]]

- the **margin** between the plates can be:
	- moving apart; **divergent**
	- moving towards each other; **convergent**
	- sliding past; **transform**

- the **mid ocean** **ridges** are created by seafloor plates **diverging**
	- magma created from decompressed mantle rock
	- rises upwards and forms new floor

![[chart18 copy.png|300]]

- the **deep sea trenches** are created by seafloor plates **converging**
	- a **subduction** is when a plate subducts beneath another 
	- brings water down to the mantle, **melts mantle rock**, forming **magma**
	- this forms volcanic arcs

## Permian Mass Extinction
- "The Great Dying"
- happened **right before** the Triassic start

1. The Permian sees a **reduction** in **continental shelves** and **suitable land habitat**.
2. Massive **volcano** in Siberia, and climate effects resulted in the **largest mass extinction** ever

- impact includes:
	- **70%** of land vertebrate species lost
	- **85%** of marine species lost
- survivors lived on during the Triassic as reptile diversity picked up

## Triassic Earth

### Climate
- arid and **incredibly hot** most of the year
- short summer of intense monsoon rains
- coastal areas were humid

### Vegetation

### Marine life
- abundant in **shallow waters**
- vertebrates and invertebrates
- i.e. the Plesiosaurs, Ichthyosaurs
- feed on invertebrate coils called **ammonoids**

### Terrestrial Life
- includes most of the [[1_Tetrapods#Amniotes|Amniotes]]
- the [[1_Tetrapods#Archosaurs|Pseudosuchia]] (crocodilian) were **apex predators**

### Fossil record
- Triassic terrestrial strata is significantly **less exposed** compared to Jurassic and Cretaceous
- the **oldest dinosaur fossil** (230 Ma) found at **Valle de la Luna** ("*Valley of the Moon*") in Argentina
	- this was a humid coastal area in the Pangea, along the shoreline of [[#The Supercontinent|Gondwana]]
