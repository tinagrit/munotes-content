Lecture 8

## The Supercontinent
- all Earth's continental **crust assembled** in the [[2_Geologic Time#The Paleozoic Era|Late Paleozoic]]
- "one big landmass" called **Pangea
	- Pan (all, across)
	- Gaia (Mother Earth, land)

### Tectonic plates
- **lithosphere** refers to the Earth's crust and the upper mantle
- it is broken into many fragments called **lithospheric plates** (*tectonic plates*)
- theses plate **move**, due to the **convection** of the rocks underneath the crust (*asthenosphere*)
	- the **convection current** moves ductile rocks around

- the **margin** between the plates can be:
	- moving apart; **divergent**
	- moving towards each other; **convergent**
	- sliding past; **transform**

- the mid ocean **ridges** are created by seafloor plates **diverging**
	- magma created from decompressed mantle rock
	- rises upwards and forms new floor
