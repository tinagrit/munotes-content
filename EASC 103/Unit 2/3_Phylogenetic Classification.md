Lecture 9 & 10


## Monophyletic
- dinosaur and vertebrate clades (see [[1_Classification|Dinosaur Classification]] and the [[1_Tetrapods|Tetrapod Family tree]]) use **phylogenetic classification**
- this system of classification is **rank less**
- works well for vertebrates, since evolutionary **relationships are complex**
- a phylogenetic **tree** can also show **geologic time** 
- a new **clade** refers to a new evolutionary novelty that is passed down to all descendants
	- clades are **monophyletic**, it includes the ancestor and **all** descendants, regardless of how the descendants have evolved
	- going further down the tree, characteristics are **more derived**

For example, the **Tyrannosaurus rex** phylogenetic classification is:

```
Tetrapoda
\- Amniota
   \- Archosauria
      \- Avemetatarsalia
         \- Dinosauria
            \- Saurischia
               \- Therapoda
                  \- Coelurosauria
                     \- Tyrannosauroidea
                        \- Tyrannosauridae
                           \- Tyrannosaurus rex
```


## Linnaean Classification
- **ranked** system that works well for **invertebrates**
	- their fossil record is much more complete
	- simpler evolutionary relationships
- dinosaurs and many other species are **named** using this system
- the **genus** and **specie** are written in *italics*

For example, the **Tyrannosaurus rex** linnaean classification is:

| Level   | Name                |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| Kingdom | Animalia            |
| Phylum  | Chordata            |
| Class   | Reptilia            |
| Order   | Theropoda           |
| Family  | Tyrannosauridae     |
| Genus   | *Tyrannosaurus*     |
| Specie  | *Tyrannosaurus rex* |

For comparison, the **human** linnaean classification is:

| Level   | Name           |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Kingdom | Animalia       |
| Phylum  | Chordata       |
| Class   | Mamalia        |
| Order   | Primates       |
| Family  | Hominidae      |
| Genus   | *Homo*         |
| Specie  | *Homo sapiens* |

### Specie Naming Convention
- species are **binomen**
- its name includes:
	- the **generic** name (genus) in *italic*, with the first letter capitalized, e.g. *Tyrannosaurus*
	- the **specific** name, in *italic*, not capitalized, e.g. *rex*
