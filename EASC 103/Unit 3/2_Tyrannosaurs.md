- evolution of feathers
	- protofeathers (1)
	- plumulaceous feathers (2)

	- flight feathers (5)

### Tyrannosauroidea

## Proceratosauridae
- means "*front horn*"
- **nasal press** at the front of the skull
- extremely long nares

### *Guanlong*
- means "*crowned dragon*"
- early proceratosaurid
- lived in **China, 160 Ma**
- large, thin elaborate **crest** (not shown in juveniles)
- matures at 7 years old
- is assumed to be covered in feathers
- known from **2 specimens**, found stacked on top of each other
	- Junggar Basin of northern China
	- "**Death trap**" pit of mud
	- mudstone pit entombs **5 stacked dinosaurs**
- described and named by **Xu Xing**, a Chinese palaeontologist
	- he's named 33 dinosaur species, more than any other living palaeontologist 
	- many of his discoveries are from the [[3_Compsognathids#Yixian Formation|Yixian Formation]]

### *Dilong*
- means "*emperor dragon*"
- discovered with **feathered** integument
- known from **2 specimens**
- also one of **Xu Xing**'s named dinosaurs in the **Yixian Formation**

### *Yutyrannus*
- means "*feathered tyrant*"
- 9 metres in length
- known from **3 specimens**
- shaggy coat of long protofeathers
- also one of **Xu Xing**'s named dinosaurs in the **Yixian Formation**


---

## Tyrannosauridae
- reduction in forelimb size
- lost digit III, down to 2

### *Daspletosaurus* 
- means "*frightful lizard*"
- Western **North America, 75 Ma**
- only other tyrannosaurid is [[#*Gorgosaurus*|Gorgosaurus]]
- **robust** dinosaur

### *Gorgosaurus*
- means "*fierce lizard*"
- Western **North America, 75 Ma**
- only other tyrannosaurid is [[#*Daspletosaurus*|Daspletosaurus]]
- **gracile** dinosaur

### *Albertosaurus*
- means "*Alberta lizard*"
- Western **North America, 70 Ma**

### *Tarbosaurus*
- means "*alarming lizard*"
- **Mongolia, 70 Ma** (today's Gobi desert)
- found in the same unit as [[4_Ornithomimosaurs#*Gallimimus*|Gallimimus]] and [[4_Ornithomimosaurs#*Deinocheirus*|Deinocheirus]]
- **robust** dinosaur
- smaller than the T-rex, narrower skull and shorter forelimbs

> [!tip] Note
> Theropods have firm lips, teeth are not exposed.


---

## *Tyrannosaurus rex*
- belongs to [[#Tyrannosauridae]]
- name means "tyrant lizard king"
- one of the **last tyrannosaurid line**
- dominated **North America 68-66 Ma**
- we **don't know** if it has feathers or not
- fossils found:
	- Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan
	- **Hell Creek Formation** of Montana, Wyoming, Dakotas

> [!tip] Note
> The T-rex had the **largest bite force** among all terrestrial animals.

- T-Rex lived in the **forests** along the coast of the **Western Interior Seaway**
	- sea level fell in the early [[2_Geologic Time#Time Scale|Paleogene]]
- Domination at the end of [[2_Geologic Time#Cretaceous Period|Cretaceous]]
	- **Mosasaurus** dominated the seaway
	- **Quetzalcoatlus** dominated the skies
	- **T-rex** dominated the land
- Dinosaurs that lived at the same time include: Edmontosaurus, Triceratops, [[4_Tracks#Ankylosaurs|Ankylosaurs]]

### Determining sex
- no clear differences on the skeletons
- a T-rex is **a female** if:
	1. **eggs** are present in the absomen
	2. **medullary bone** in the femur is present (this is the case for the specimen **B-rex**)

### Determining age
- dinosaur growth halts in the winter
- cutting open a bone, a **line of arrested growth** (*LAGs*) is shown
- each line indicate **one year** the dinosaur lived
- as shown in the image, growth is fastest from age 12-18
