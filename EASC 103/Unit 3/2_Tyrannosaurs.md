- extremely long nares

### *Guanlong*

- lived in **China, 160 Ma**
- large, thin elaborate **crest** (not shown in juveniles)

- described and named by **Xu Xing**, a Chinese palaeontologist
	- he's named 33 dinosaur species, more than any other living palaeontologist 
	- many of his discoveries are from [[2_Geologic Time#Cretaceous Period|Early Cretaceous]] beds in the **Yixian Formation** of Liaoning Province, China. These beds have exquisite preservation

- known from **3 specimens**
- shaggy coat of long protofeathers
