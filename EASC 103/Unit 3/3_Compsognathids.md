## Compsognathidae
- **small** theropods from the [[2_Geologic Time#Jurassic Period|Late Jurassic]] and [[2_Geologic Time#Cretaceous Period|Early Cretaceous]]
- known from very few specimens
- a **problematic clade**, since all of them are juveniles
	- lack of info; we don't know if they are just juveniles of other clades
	- young theropods are very similar to each other

	        |-- Maniraptoriformes
            |-- Tyrannosauroidea
            \-- Compsognathidae

```

### *Compsognathus*
- name means "*elegant/dainty jaw*"
	- refers to its [[2_Skeletal Anatomy#The Skull|mandible]]
- lived **Late Jurassic** in **Europe/Germany**
- 2 specimens found in [[#Solnhöfen Limestone|Solnhöfen Limestone]]
	- both specimens have lizards in their stomach

### *Sinosauropteryx prima*
- name means "*Chinese lizard wing first*"
- discovered in **1996**, **first** non-avian dinosaur with **feathers** (only brown is preserved)
- first dinosaur with **colours** determined in **2010**
	- evidence of **melanosomes**, containing structures of pigment within the keratin of feathers
- lived in an open habitat, has **countershading** 
	- dark [[2_Skeletal Anatomy#Orientation|dorsal]] and light [[2_Skeletal Anatomy#Orientation|ventral]]
	- **evens out** the effect of shadowing when sunlight shines from the top
	- benefits for both predators and prey

## Lagerstätte
- means "**place of storage**"
- where [[3_Fossils#Fossils|stratas]] are located

### Solnhöfen Limestone
- in **Europe/Germany**
- has **Late Jurassic** specimens, **150 Ma**
- shows exquisite preservation, some with integument
	- [[#*Compsognathus*|Compsognathus]] and 12 *Archaeopteryx*
	- lime mud deposited as tiny grains of **Calcium carbonate**
- northern shores on the [[4_Triassic Earth#The Supercontinent|Tethys Ocean]]
	- a **lagoon** separated from the ocean, an **archipelago** (*chain*) of small islands
	- is **hypersaline** (*very salty*), not many animals are found here

### Yixian Formation
- in **China** - Liaoning Province
- has **Early Cretaceous** specimens, **125 Ma**
- shows exquisite preservation
	- [[#*Sinosauropteryx prima*|Sinosauropteryx prima]]
- the "**Dinosaur Pompeii**", preserved of volcanic origin
	- **pyroclastic flows** - hot ash, pumice, volcanic gas
	- **lahars** - volcanic mudflows
