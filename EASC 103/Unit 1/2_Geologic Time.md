Lectures 1 & 3


## Time Scale
- the time scale of Earth history is divided into **eons**, **eras**, **periods**,  and **epochs** (largest to smallest)
- the units used for years are:
	- **Ka** (*kilo-annum*) a thousand years ago
	- **Ma** (*mega-annum*) a million years ago
	- **Ga** (*giga-annum*) a billion years ago
- The **majority** (88%) of the Earth history are **Precambrian** (the first 3 eons), before any large life has evolved. The rest (12%) is the **Phanerozoic** era, where everything else happens.

## The Precambrian Earth

### Hadean Eon
- begins at **4.567 Ga**, when Earth was formed
- **no rock sample** from this era (tectonic plate works removed evidence), but age determined by other materials like meteorites
- life evolved as single-celled **chemosynthetic** bacteria
	- synthesize chemicals from hydrothermal vents at mid-ocean ridges (MOR) along deep ocean floor
	- where tectonic plates **spead apart**

### Archean Eon
- begins at **4.0 Ga**, with the first rock record **Acasta Gneiss** along the western edge of the Canadian Shield
- age of rocks found through **radioactive methods**
- the **stromatolites**, oldest fossilized life, dated at 3.5 Ga
	- mounds built by an algal mat (*large colony*) of **cyanobacteria**, a photosynthetic bacteria
	- **exists today** where predation is low, such as **hypersaline** (*very salty*) embayments, e.g. Shark Bay

### Proterozoic Eon
- begins at **2.5 Ga**, where banded iron formations (**BIFs**) rocks are found.
- There was **no oxygen** in the atmosphere. Oxygen produced by **cyanobacteria** chemically bonded to **iron** (Fe) and **silica** (Si) on the ocean floor, creating the BIFs and their patterns.
$$
\begin{align}
\text{Si }+\text{ O}_{2}\text{ } & =\text{ SiO}_{2} \\
4\text{Fe }+\text{ }3\text{O}_{2}\text{ } & =\text{ }2\text{Fe}_{2}\text{O}_{3}
\end{align}
$$

- The iron in the ocean was used up, and oxygen **escaped to the atmosphere**
- By the end of the eon, there was **enough oxygen** in the atmosphere for the **first large life** to evolve
	- the group of all life forms is called **Ediacaran Biota**
	- this includes the **Dickinsonia**, a flat, bath-mat looking organism

## The Paleozoic Era
*Age of Invertebrates*
- begins at **539 Ma** with the **Cambrian Explosion**
- life increases in **complexity**, predator-prey relationships introduced
	- oceans dominated by invertebrate animals (See [[1_Classification#Animal groups|Vertebrates]])

> [!note] Note
> The **Dimetrodon** (a synapsid, non-dinosaur) lived during the Permian in this era.

- all continents are united into a **supercontinent**
- sees the first:
	- **fish** during the Cambrian
	- **land plants/insects** during the Ordovician
	- **forests** during the Devonian
	- **amphibians** during the Mississippian
	- **reptiles** during the Pennsylvanian
- massive **volcano** in Siberia results in the **Permian mass extinction**, ending the era

## The Mesozoic Era
*Age of Reptiles*
- begins at **252 Ma**, after the Permian mass extinction
- reptiles **dominate** the land, skies, and seas
	- most significant era for the dinosaurs

### Triassic Period
- spans **252-201 Ma**
	- divided into epochs of **Early, Middle, and Late** Triassic
- **mammals** evolve in the Late epoch, but not as diverse or abundant as reptiles
- sees dinosaurs like the **Eoraptor** (See [[1_Classification#The Pelvis|Saurischian Sauropodomorphians]]; *one of the earliest known dinosaurs*)

### Jurassic Period
- spans **201-145 Ma**
	- divided into epochs of **Early, Middle, and Late** Jurassic
- the earliest **birds** appear by the Late epoch
- sees dinosaurs like the **Stegosaurus** (See [[1_Classification#The Pelvis|Ornithischian Thyreophorans]])

### Cretaceous Period
- spans **145-66 Ma**
	- divided into epochs of **Early and Late** Cretaceous
- sees dinosaurs like the **Tyrannosaurus rex** (See [[1_Classification#Theropods|Saurischian Theropod Coelurosaurs]])

![[Screenshot 2025-09-10 at 5.07.15 PM.png|300]]

- sees the end of the Mesozoic Era with an **asteroid impact** 66 Ma in the **Gulf of Mexico**
	- the only dinosaurs that **survive** the mass extinction are the [[1_Classification#Theropods|Avian Theropods]] (birds)
	- impact darkens the skies for months

---

## The Cenozoic Era
*Age of Mammals*
- begins at **66 Ma**, after the Cretaceous mass extinction
- **mammals and birds** survive the impact, and dominate this era
- we are in this era right now, the **present day** is part of the Quaternary period
