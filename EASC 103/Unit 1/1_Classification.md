Lectures 1 & 2


## What are dinosaurs
- Dinosauria $\implies$ Deinos (*Greek* for **terrible**) + Sauros (*Greek* for **lizard**)
	- term coined by **Richard Owen**, a British comparative anatomist and authority on fossil reptiles
- As an animal, dinosaurs belong to the **archosaur diapsid amniote tetrapod vertebrate** animal group (see [[#Animal groups]])

### Animal groups
- **Vertebrates** are all animals with **backbones**, a spinal column
	- Vertebrates include fish, frogs, cats, dogs, humans, snakes, crocodiles, etc.
	- *In*vertebrates include insects, spiders, jellyfish, etc.
- **[[1_Tetrapods|Tetrapods]]** are *vertebrates* with **4 limbs** and their descendants
	- Tetrapods include all of the examples above *except* fish
- **Amniotes** are *tetrapods* that reproduce via an **enclosed amniotic egg**
	- Amniotes include all of the examples above *except* fish and frogs

Amniotes can be **synapsids** or **diapsids**. There is a skull difference between the two. 
- **Synapsids** have 1 temporal fenestra (*an indentation in the skull*) low down behind each eye orbit
	- Synapsids include humans and other mammals
- **Diapsids** have 2 temporal fenestra behind each eye orbit
	- Diapsids include dinosaurs, lizards, snakes, etc.

> [!notes] Note
> The **Dimetrodon** is a **synapsid**, and therefore **not** a dinosaur.

> It lived during the *Permian*, prior to the *Paleozoic Era* (See [[2_Geologic Time#The Paleozoic Era|Paleozoic Era]])

Diapsids are categorized into **archosaurs** and **lepidosaurs**.
- **Archosaurs** have semi- to fully upright postures. This includes:
	- **dinosaurs**
	- *pterosaurs* ("**winged lizards**"; very closely related to dinosaurs; aren't dinosaurs)
	- crocodiles
- **Lepidosaurs** have sprawling postures. This includes:
	- tuatara
	- *squamates* like snakes, lizards, geckos

## Cladogram
- The cladogram classifies dinosaurs based on **evolutionary novelties**.
	- refers to a trait that first **appears in the ancestor** and gets inherited by all descendants
- Dinosaurs are classified into **clades**.
	- Clades are **monophyletic**, meaning they include **all descendants**, even if the descendant has evolved into something more similar to other clades
	- **Convergent evolution** refers to two unrelated species in two different clades evolve similar traits

## Anatomy

### The Pelvis
- The two main clades of dinosaurs are **Saurischian** and **Ornithischian**. This is based on how the bones in their **pelvis** (hips) are shaped
- **Saurischians** (*lizard hipped*; saur means lizard) have their pubis point forward
	- include the [[#Theropods|theropods]] (*beast foot*) and the **sauropodomorphians** (*lizard foot forms*)
		- Sauropodomorphians include the **prosauropods** and the **sauropods** (*the long necks*)
	- eg. Allosaurus
- **Ornithischians** (*bird hipped*; ornitho means bird) have their pubis point backward, they include:
	- **Thyreophora** (*shield-bearing*) including **Stegosauria** (*plated dinos*) and **Ankylosauria** (*dino tanks*)
		- rows of **bony armour** above and along the vertebral column
	- **Marginocephalia** (*margin-headed*) 
		- thickened **ridge of bone**, a bump, at the back of the skull
		- frill (*Ceratopsia*) or dome (*Pachycephalosauria*)
	- **Ornithopods** (*bird foot*) 
		- no armour; has **facultative bipeds**, meaning they can walk/run on 2 legs
	- eg. Edmontosaurus

> [!warning] Note
> Although ornithiscians mean "**bird** hipped", all birds are **theropods** and therefore are **saurischians**. However, their pubis point backward, similar to ornithiscians. This is due to **convergent evolution** and they are not related to ornithiscians.

#### Theropods
- are **Saurischians**, means ***beast foot***
- About **50%** of all ~1,000 species of dinosaurs are theropods
- The **coelurosaurs** are theropods that are fully feathered. They have large **diversity of lifestyles**: carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores.
	- eg. Ornithomimosaurs (*bird mimic lizards*)

> [!tip] Note
> The **Tyrannosaurus rex** is a coelurosaur, but isn't fully feathered, due to the feathers not being advantageous to its living, and it evolved accordingly.

- Within the coelurosaurs, there exists the **paraves**, and the **avialae**, which is the only **avian** **theropod**.
	- Examples of Paraves include *Velociraptor* and *Archaeopteryx* 
	- Avialae includes **all ancient and modern birds**
	- This is the **only extant** (*existing*) type of dinosaurs


### The Skull
- The top part is the **Cranium**. "*Cranium holds the* brain*ium*"
	- The part that holds the teeth is the **Maxilla**
	- The part in front of the Maxilla is the **Premaxilla**
- The bottom part is the **Mandible**.
	- The part that holds the teeth is the **Dentary**
	- The part in front of the Dentary is the **Predentary**

- The Saurischian and Ornithischian have slightly different skulls.
	- The **Ornithischian** has **toothless** predentary

### The Ossified Tendons
- has a **criss-crossing** pattern at the top
- mostly in the **Ornithischians**, spans the **entire body**
- can be seen in **Saurischians** (*coelurosaurs; fully feathered theropods*), but only **along the tails**

![[Screenshot 2025-09-13 at 4.08.23 PM.png|700]]

### The Tail Vertebrae
- **Chevron** - a v-shaped boned extending below the tail's vertebrae protecting blood vessels and providing muscle attachment points in the tail
- **Centrum** - the centre piece bone of the vertebrae
- **Neural spines** goes above the centrum
