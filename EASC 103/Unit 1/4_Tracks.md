Lecture 5


## Tracks 
- impressions made in **soft substrate** (layer) of animal walking, running or leaping
- tracks in **fine grained material** (e.g. mud or volcanic ash) preserve the **greatest details**, like fingerprint impressions
- information retrieved includes:
	- general **size** of the dinosaur
	- type of **dinosaur**
	- type of **environment**

### Toes
- the **Hallux** is the **big toe**, marked as **digit I**
	- provides support/balance
- the rest of the toes are numbered accordingly (digit II, III, IV, ...)

### Trackways
- show **sequences of tracks** made by dinosaur movement
- give us information like:
	- how they walk
		- **bipeds** - 2 legs, [[1_Classification#Theropods|theropods]]
		- **quadrupeds** - 4 legs, e.g. triceratops, sauropods
		- **facultative bipeds** - spends most of the time being quadrupeds, but can also walk as bipeds, [[1_Classification#The Pelvis|ornithopods]]
	- type of **locomotion** (walking, running, jumping)
	- if they move as a **pack/herd**
	- their **height and length**

- tracks differ between the hands and feet
	- **manus** - the hands (two fore foot), remember as "manus - *manu*al labour - hands"
	- **ped** - the feet (two rear limbs), remember as "ped - *ped*aling - feet"

> [!tip] Note
> The **Six Peaks Dinosaur Track Site** near Tumbler Ridge, BC is one of the largest dinosaur trackway sites in the world.

## Identification

### Sauropods 
- See [[1_Classification#The Pelvis|Saurischian Sauropodomorphians]]
- are **quadrupeds**
- capable of **rearing up** (stand on two feet to reach higher, but can't walk on two)
- are **oval shaped** pedal tracks
- shows **5 digits**
	- **sometimes** claw impression on digit IV, but never on V

### Ankylosaurs 
- See [[1_Classification#The Pelvis|Ornithischian Ankylosaurs]]
- are **quadrupeds**
- shows **4 rounded digits**, unique amongst dinosaurs
- digits are spread out, no claws present

### Ornithopods
- See [[1_Classification#The Pelvis|Ornithischian Ornithopods]]
- are **facultative bipeds**, some shows 4 limbs, some shows 2
- shows **3 rounded digits** on a **U-shaped** print

### Theropods 
- See [[1_Classification#Theropods|Saurischian Theropods]]
- are **bipeds**
- shows **3 clawed digits** on a **V-shaped** print
	- the Hallux (digit I) is not present since it doesn't touch the ground
- shows a **theropod notch**, a small indent behind digit II

#### Determining size of Theropods
- a **trackway** is required to determine a theropod size
	- the **pace** is the distance between left and right foot
	- the **stride** is the distance between the same foot
- the **Hip Height** is measured from the ground to the top of the back, for a walking theropod, is approximately:
$$
\text{Hip Height}=\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot \text{Stride}
$$

- the **length** is the distance from the tip the snout to the tip of the tail
	- the formula to find length is different between theropod sizes since their relative proportions differ
	- for a **small theropod**: $\text{Length}=4\cdot \text{Hip Height}$
	- for a **large theropod**: $\text{Length}=2\cdot \text{Hip Height}+3.5$
