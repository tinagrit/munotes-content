## Rocks
The Earth's crust is made of **3 major types of rocks**
- **Metamorphic rock** - recrystallization of minerals at depth under high heat and pressure 
	- ex. slate, gneiss
- **Igneous rock** - crystallization of molten rock, including **magma** (*intrusive*, below surface) and **lava** (*extrusive*, above surface)
	- ex. granite, basalt
- **Sedimentary rock** - lithification of sediment grains, results of weathering and erosion
	- only type of rocks that **may contain fossils**
	- ex. shale, sandstone

> [!tip] Note
> The rocks around Vancouver are **igneous** and **metamorphic**. Therefore, dinosaur fossils **cannot be found** here.


## Fossils
- **evidence of past life** preserved in materials of the Earth's crust
	- found in **strata**, including all sediments and sedimentary rocks, volcanic ash and lava flows
	- volcanic ash **covers and preserves** fossils
	- the rocks that contain fossils are called **matrix**
- 2 types of fossils include **Body fossils** and **Trace fossils**

> [!warning] Note
> The evidence **must be older** than the [[2_Geologic Time#Time Scale|current epoch]] (Holocene). Therefore, a fossil only counts if it is older than 11.8 Ka.

### Body Fossils
- fossilized **skeletal material** (bones and teeth), rarely **integument** (body coverings), and even more rarely **skin** (mummified) 
- Soft parts being preserved is **very rare** and requires **exquisite preservation**, such as the Trilobites being covered by fine volcanic ash

### Trace Fossils
- evidence of the **behaviour** of an organism (*what they left behind*)
- tracks, eggs, nests, bite marks, coprolites and gastroliths (*fossilized poop*)
	- eggs and coprolites may be **produced** by the body, but are **not part** of the body, and therefore are trace fossils
	- bite marks provide evidence of **predatory** and **scavenging** behaviour.
	- the [[2_Geologic Time#Archean Eon|bacterial mounds]] also count as trace fossils

---

## Fossilization
1. organism **dies** from predation or natural causes
2. **scavenging** occurs, soft tissues **broken down** by the elements and bacteria
3. breakdown process only halts if remaining carcass is **covered** by sediment or volcanic ash
4. fossilization occurs through one of two processes
	-  **Petrifaction** - atom by atom replacement of organic material with minerals
	-  **Permineralization** - pores and open spaces being filled with minerals

### Collecting fossils
- an **air scribe** is used by fossil preparators to remove hard matrix from around the fossil bone
- once the excavated dinosaur is ready to remove from the ground, it is covered in a **plaster jacket** (*protective casing for transport*)

### States of fossils
*(from best to worst)*
- **Dino mummy** - soft-part preservation: skin and organs
- **Bone bed** - many dinosaurs that died at the same time
- **Articulated** **complete** skeleton 
- **Articulated** **partial** skeleton
- Disarticulated but lots of skeleton present
- Disarticulated and incomplete
- Disarticulated small broken bits and pieces

### Known fossil records
- limited to discoveries from **mesozoic aged** strata
- **>1000** **species** of known non-avian (*not flying*) dinosaurs
	- around half (~50%) of all species are [[1_Classification#Theropods|theropods]]
	- the other half comprised of [[1_Classification#The Pelvis|ornithschia]] and [[1_Classification#The Pelvis|sauropodomorpha]] members
	- only **10 species** are found in Alberta 
- **only 20%** of species that we have **complete specimens** for
	- dinosaurs like the **Koreaceratops** are only known from one specimen
- The fossil specimen used to describe and name an organism within a peer reviewed journal is called a **Holotype**
- there are **~125** paid dinosaur palaeontologists worldwide
