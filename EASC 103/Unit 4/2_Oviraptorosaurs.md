## Oviraptorosauria
- discovered in **Mongolia** in 1923 by **Roy Chapman Andrews**
- means "*egg thief lizard*"
	- fossils found **next to egg nest**
	- originally concluded that they died while stealing eggs that resembled the *Protoceratops* eggs
	- turns out, evidence found by **Mark Norell** suggested that they died **protecting their own** eggs
- unique features include
	- box-like skulls
	- short snouts
	- large *mandibular fenestra*
	- few or no teeth
	- short and thick tail

Oviraptorosaurs are classified into 2 main clades
- [[#Caenagnathidae|Caenagnathidae]] (Asia & North America)
- [[#Oviraptoridae|Oviraptoridae]] (Asia)

### Rapid burial
- Oviraptorosaurs are found in **Gobi  Desert** of Mongolia
- from **85-70 Ma, Late Cretaceous**
- excellent fossil preservation, no integument
- dramatic **storms** caused rapid burial in the sand
	- sandstorms **suffocate** dinosaurs out in the open
	- rainstorms causing **fail dunes** burying dinosaurs at the foot of the dunes

### Brooding
- means **sitting** on the eggs
- long feather forelimbs **wrap and protect**
- nest is made of a **raised mound** surrounding an **excavated pit**, where the parents crouch in
- clutch of eggs laid **in pairs** over days/weeks

### *Caudipteryx*
- name means "*tail feather*"
- basal Oviraptorosaur
- lived in **China, 125 Ma, Early Cretaceous**, Yixian Formation
- found in 1997 with preserved gastroliths
- clump of **long pennaceous feathers** attached to short tails
- has **"pygostyle"**, last few vertebrae of tail fused together
