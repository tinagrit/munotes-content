Lecture 18 & 19

## The Encephalization Quotient
- measures a species **intelligence** compared to another
- uses the **brain mass** and **body mass**, adjusted for their body size

> [!tip] Note
> Amongst dinosaurs, **ornithopods** and **theropods** (especially Coelurosaurs) have the highest EQ.

## Paraves
- means "*similar to modern birds*"
	- **para** - *near to*/*similar to*
	- **aves** - *modern birds*
- top of the theropod evolutionary novelties ladder
	- enlarged, **retractable** digit II
	- hyperextended (retracted) position for walking
	- **sickle claws** move through 180Â° arc
- common ancestor evolved **<160 Ma** **Late Jurassic** but likely appeared earlier in the Middle Jurassic

Paraves is classified into 3 main clades
- [[#Dromaeosaurs|Dromaeosaurs]]
- [[#Troodontidae|Troodontids]]
- Avialae

### Dromaeosaurs
- means "*running lizards*", includes the raptors
- known from **all continents**
- includes members of all sizes

Dromaeosaurs are classified into 2 main clades
- the more basal [[#Microraptoria|Microraptoria]]
- the more derived [[#Eudromaeosauria|Eudromaeosauria]]

---

## Microraptoria
- basal Dromaeosaurs
- may have been **semiarboreal**, lived on trees
- may be capable of **powered flights**
- found in **Yixian Formation, Early Cretaceous**
- many displayed winged rear limbs

### Microraptor
- lived in **China, 130 Ma, Early Cretaceous**, Yixian Formation
- not a bird, but resembles one
- dark iridescent colour
- long feather at the end of tail


---

## Eudromaeosauria
- means "*true* Dromaeosaurs"
- almost exclusively from **Northern hemisphere**

### *Deinonychus*
- name means "*terrible claw*"
- discovered 1960s by **John Ostron** in Montana
- lived in **North America, 110 Ma, Early Cretaceous**
- medium sized, larger than the Velociraptor
- very active and predaceous animal

> [!tip] Endotherm theropods
> John Ostron, who discovered Deinonychus, proposed that theropods are **endotherms** like modern birds.
> - Endotherms (*warm-blooded*) get heat through metabolism
> - Ectotherms (*cold-blooded*) get heat through the Sun and external sources

### *Utahraptor*
- lived in **North America, 130 Ma, Early Cretaceous**
- ambush predator, unlike [[#*Deinonychus*|Deinonychus]]
- largest known Dromaeosaur, heavily built

### *Velociraptor*
- name means "*swift plunderer*"
- discovered in **Mongolia** in 1923 by **Roy Chapman Andrews** 
	- The "*Flaming Cliffs*"
	- discovered crushed skull and sickle claw (previously misidentified as hand claw)
	- full specimen discovered in 1971
- small sized theropod
- evidence of feathers
- lived in **Mongolia, 75-71 Ma, Late Cretaceous**
- preyed on **small animals**, using the *Raptor-Prey Restraint* predation similar to modern birds
- specimen known as "*The Fighting Dinosaurs*" found **fighting** with *Protoceratops*

> [!tip] Note
> Velociraptor was popularized by **Jurassic Park**, although the movie version is fashioned after [[#*Deinonychus*|Deinonychus]], including its skull and pronated hands.

## Troodontidae
- sister clade of the Avialae

### *Mei long*
- name means "*soundly sleeping dragon*"
- **very small** basal troodontid
- lived in **China, 125 Ma, Early Cretaceous**, Yixian Formation
