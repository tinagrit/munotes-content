## Avialae 
- includes all species more closely related to modern birds than to Dromaeosaurs or Troodontids

> [!tip] Note 
> Birds are highly derived avian **theropods**. They are descendants of dinosaurs.

## Modern Bird Anatomy
- key adaptations for powered flights and lifestyle of modern birds (*Aves*)
- lots of air in the body â†’ **lightens** the bird
	- works as respiration supercharger
	- air cooled system

### Skeletal
- limb bones are **hollow**, **thin-walled**, and **pneumatic**.
	- small ducts that allow air to pass through
	- connected to **air sacs** and lungs
- fused **hands** (*carpometacarpus*)
- fused **feet** (*tarsometatartus*)
	- grasping pedal digits
	- backward hallux
- fused **pelvis** - bone joining ischium + pubis
- fused ***Synsacrum*** - joining dorsal + caudal vertebrae
- very large, strongly keeled **sternum** for powerful flights
- short tail, last few vertebrae used as **pygostyle** to support tail feathers

### Feathers
- complex pennaceous and flight featherse
	- the **Primaries** - symmetrical flight feathers at carcometacarpus
	- the **Secondaries** - asymmetrical pennaceous feathers at bowed ulna
	- the **Tertials** - small feathers on some Avialae at humerus
- thumb feather called **alula** helps with controlled landing

## Transitional bird

### *Confuciusornis*
- lived in **China, 125 Ma, Early Cretaceous**
- "missing link" between archaic birds and modern birds
	- small sternum
	- unfused claw digits
	- no teeth
	- no fused pelvis and synsacrum
	- short tails only in females

---

## Archaic bird

### *Archaeopteryx*
- name means "*ancient wing*".
- lived in **Europe, 150 Ma, Late Jurassic**, Solnhofen Limestone
- discovered in 1860 as single fossil feather
- has flight feathers and backward pubis, but **doesn't share** much else with modern birds, for example:
	- long bony tail
	- sharp teeth
	- retractable digit II
- Archaeopteryx has more in common with [[3_Dromaeosaurs#*Velociraptor*|Velociraptor]] than other Avialaes
