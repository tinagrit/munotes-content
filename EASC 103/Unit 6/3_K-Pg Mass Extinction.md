Lecture 29

## The Asteroid
- 66 million years ago
- The dinosaurs reign of the Jurassic and Cretaceous **ended in an instant**
- Asteroid the size of **Mount Everest** hits the shallow seafloor in the **Gulf of Mexico**
	- ~10 km in diameter
	- energy impact ~100 million nuclear bombs

> [!tip] Note
> The K-Pg used be called **K-T Extinction** when the Paleogene was called Tertiary

### Casualties
- all **non-avian** **dinosaurs** and **pterosaurs** went extinct
- **large marine reptiles** (plesiosaurs, mosasaurs), **ammonoids** went extinct
- many species of **microbiota** (plankton, foraminifera: single celled protozoans that feed on plankton), went extinct

### The Alvarez Hypothesis
- In 1980 by **Walter** and **Luis Alvarez**
- explains the **sudden extinction**, and what happens on Earth during and after the impact
	- **Ejecta** (obliterated asteroid or sediments it slammed into) blasted high and hurtled back as **molten droplets**, fire ignited everywhere
	- **Impact tsunami** devastated the area
	- **Fine ejecta** (dust) blocked the sun for months, affect photosynthesis and crash food chains
- Plants, then plant eaters, then meat eaters died

## Discovery
- Gubbio, Italy has limestones **from the deep sea**, pushed up as a mountain by tectonic activities
	- Walter Alvarez analyzed microfossils of foraminifera
	- At the top of a white layer, there is a small clay layer, and after that most of the species found in the bottom layer **are gone**
- Zumaia, Spain has similar limestone rocks at the coast
	- Same sharp, sudden clay layer
	- The K-Pg boundary
	- Base of the marine food chain disappeared, boundary shows little evidence of life of very small species

### Hypothesis
- Luis Alvarez realizes that **iridium** is rare on Earth's crust, but found in meteorites
	- Iridium falls in an invisible rain of cosmic space dust
	- The boundary contains **30 times** more iridium than surrounding rocks
	- Sample from other K-Pg sites returned similar values
- Alvarez wondered if a **supernova** exploding nearby was responsible
	- Only 1 in a billion chance
	- Supernova would deposit isotope **plutonium 244**, but this was not present
- Alvarez hypothesizes that an **asteroid** or comet caused the destruction
	- Calculating the amount of iridium present on Earth, Alvarez concludes that an asteroid **10 km** in diameter hits the Earth
	- Slammed at **80,000 km/h**, 20 times faster than a bullet
	- Heated the air to **several times** the temperature of the Sun
	- See [[#The Alvarez Hypothesis]]

### Trail of Evidence
- Palaeontologists did not accept the Alvarez Hypothesis due to the lack of crater that matches the description
	- Alvarez claims that a crater should be **200 kilometres** across
	- Crater might never be found if the asteroid landed on water
	- Focus shifted to finding trail of debris evidence
- Jan Smit discovered glass like beads called **spherules** in K-Pg boundaries
	- Discovered **shock quartz**, rocks that were shocked by the impact and had criss crossing bands of dislocated minerals
	- Evidence of an explosion
- Brazos River, Texas (~300 km from Gulf of Mexico) was also deep sea
	- Unusual deposit of sediments across the river basin, different K-Pg boundary
	- Mixtures of large boulder and Cretaceous mud, some was pulled from deep sea floor, some from shallow water
	- Evidence of **large tsunami** ~100 metre high
- Haiti has evidence of **ejecta**, full of shock minerals and spherules
	- Contains melted rock called **tektites**
	- Evidence pointed to the Gulf of Mexico
- Glen Penfield measures differences in **gravitational fields**
	- Reveals features of **giant buried crater**
	- Alan Hildebrand followed up on Penfield's work
	- Rocks nearby show all evidence of high energy impact
- **Chicxulub** crater found, named after the village it is on
	- Same age as the K-Pg boundary
	- Same size as Alvarez's prediction

### Impact
- Hell Creek Formation used to be a **lush forest**
	- Leaves and insect feeding evidence visible inside of rocks
	- No dinosaurs found above the K-Pg boundary
- Dinosaurs in the **1,000 km** radius died instantly
	- **Sulphur** blown into the atmosphere, dust obliterates the Sun
	- Non-avian dinosaurs everywhere else died later
- **60%** of all plant species disappeared
	- Ferns can germinate on a barren landscape devoid of plants
	- ~1 million years before animals come back into the landscape
- **Small animals** are ones that survived the impact
	- large population size and high reproduction rate 
	- enough survived
	- Later, **larger mammals** dominate, just like dinosaurs had done before
- Survival of the **luckiest**
