- means "**shield bearing**" dinosaurs

```

- 1+ rows of **osteoderms** above/along the vetebral column
	- bones embedded in the skin, not connected to skeleton

### *Scutellosaurus*
- name means "*little shielded lizard*"
- lived in Arizona, **North America, 196 Ma, Early Jurassic**
- most basal member known
- small **biped**
- 1.2 metre long
- weigh 10 kilograms
- thickened **scutes**, horny or bony plates, including osteoderms
	- many birds have scutes on their toes
- add **weight** to armour the dinosaur
- extra **long tail** for counterbalancing the extra weight

> [!tip] Note
> Animals that exist today (*extant*) that have scutes include crocodilians, turtles, some lizards, snakes, amphibians, and very rarely on mammals.

### *Scelidosaurus*
- name means "*limb lizard*"
	- first "mostly complete" dinosaur fossil found
	- limb bones were the first to be found
	- named by Richard Owen
- lived in **England, 191 Ma, Early Jurassic**
- **quadruped**, much larger than [[#*Scutellosaurus*|Scutellosaurus]]
- large osteoderms on back side
- **specimen** found in the 2000s along England's southwest Jurassic Coast 
	- by **David Sole**
	- hundreds of scutes found in life positions, not spread

## Stegosaurs
- means "*plated lizard*"
- medium to large **quadruped**
- vertical bony **plates** and spikes in 1/2 rows along the neck, back, and tail
- small **head**, low EQ
- short, massive **forelimbs**
- small, ridged triangular sharp **teeth**
- declined in the Early Cretaceous, **extinct** 100 Ma in the "Mid" Cretaceous
	- decline in **cycads**, their main food source

## Stegosaurids
- advanced, derived [[#Stegosaurs|Stegosaurs]]
- flatter, wider **skulls**
- **longer rear limbs** than forelimbs
- specimen "*Sophie*" is ~85% complete
- can move tail 180-degree arc
- can reach 50 km/h

Stegosaurids use:
- **erect limb posture** (upright) to move
- **sprawled forelimb pose**, tail up high, to defend

### *Kentrosaurus*
- name means "*sharp point lizard*"
- lived in **Tanzania, Late Jurassic**, Tendaguru Formation
- 4 metre long
- plates cover neck and back
- tall **spikes** and on its shoulders

### *Stegosaurus*
- name means "*roof lizard*"
- lived in Western **North America, 150 Ma, Late Jurassic**
- **Golden Age of Dinosaurs**, when [[1_Sauropods#Sauropoda|Sauropods]] are most diverse
- 9 metre long
- thin **plates** around the neck, back, hips
- 2 pairs of **spikes** at the end of the tail, called a **thagomizer**

## Ankylosauria
- means "*fused lizard*", are the "dino tanks"
- sister clade to [[#Stegosaurs|Stegosauria]]
- evolutionary novelties
	- rod of **fused vertebrae** along backside
	- broadly arched **rib cages** and hip girdle
	- small triangular **head** with low skulls
		- width between eyes > height of skull
	- closed **fenestra**, **dermal** bones on skull
- eats **low growing** vegetation, like ferns
	- chew lightly with **very tiny** leaf shaped sharp teeth

Only the **undersides** of the Ankylosaur is unprotected
- Otherwise is heavily armoured
- Defend by **squatting down** 

Ankylosauria is classified into 2 main clades:
- [[#Nodosauridae|Nodosauridae]]
- [[#Ankylosauridae|Ankylosauridae]]

| Nodosauridae          | Ankylosauridae                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Numerous spikes       | Few or no spikes                                               |
| Simple nasal passages | Complex nasal passages                                         |
| Narrow skulls         | Wider skulls<br>- heavily armoured<br>- some with bony eyelids |
|                       | Triangular bony horns                                          |
|                       | **Tail club**                                                  |

### Tail club
- round end of tail
- consists of:
	- the **handle**, caudal vertebrae fortified with **ossified tendons**
	- the **knob**, fused osteoderms

## Nodosauridae

### *Edmontonia*
- lived in **Alberta, 75 Ma, Late Cretaceous**, Dinosaur Park Formation

### *Borealopelta*
- name means "*northern shield*"
- lived in **Alberta, 115 Ma, Early Cretaceous**
- specimen is 3D dinosaur mummy
- **one in a billion** find
	- Shawn Funk, a shovel operator
	- Suncar oil sands Millennium Mine
	- Dinosaurs not normally found here
- reddish brown colour (keratin)
	- countershading belly side


## Ankylosauridae

### *Euoplocephalus*
- name means "*well-armed head*"

### *Zuul crurivastator*
- specific part of the name means "*destroyer of shins*" while *Zuul* is a character from *Ghostbusters*
- lived in Montana, **North America, 75 Ma, Late Cretaceous**
	- found while excavating another dinosaur fossil
- ~50 cm long skull
- 2.1 metre long tail club

### *Ankylosaurus*

- rare fossils
- **largest** known Ankylosaurid, 6-8 metre long
