## Ceratopsia
- means "*horn face*"
- appeared in **Asia** in the **Late Jurassic**, then spread to **North America** during the **Cretaceous**
- evolutionary novelties
	- visible **frill**, although small in primitive members
	- flaring, pointy **jugals**
	- **rostral bone** with narrow beak
		- Ceratopsians are the only dinosaurs with rostral bone

### *Psittacosaurus*
- name means "*parrot lizard*"
- a **primitive** Ceratopsian
- small **biped**
- lived in (Mongolia, China, Siberia), **Asia, Early Cretaceous**
- small frill, large jugals
- large, wide **face** with dark pigment
- highly pigmented **cloaca**
	- one hole for urinating, defecating, intercourse
- integument preserved
	- "**quills**" or "**bristles**" at the back of the tail, made of keratin
	- **countershading** low down on the body, forested habitat

## Neoceratopsia
- means "*New* Ceratopsia"
- abundant in **North America, Late Cretaceous**
- one of the best fossil records
- evolutionary novelties
	- extremely **large head**
	- prominent **frill**
	- pointed, sharply keeled **rostral bone**
	- **quadruped**

### *Protoceratops*
- name means "*first horn face*"
- lived in **Mongolia, 75 Ma, Late Cretaceous**
- small **quadruped**
- "***sexual dimorphism***", different skull for male/female
	- male has taller frill, and a pronounced bump on the snout

### *Leptoceratops*
- name means "*little horned face*"
- lived in **North America, 66 Ma, Late Cretaceous**
- similar to [[#*Protoceratops*|Protoceratops]]
- frill not as big
- a **facultative biped**

## Ceratopsidae
- highly derived and advanced Neoceratopsia
- found in **North America, Late Cretaceous**
- evolutionary novelties
	- very **large skulls**
	- large nasal openings
	- prominent **frills**
	- variety of **horns**
	- **dental battery**
- semi-**sprawled** posture with forelimbs bent outwards at elbow

Ceratopsids are classified into two main clades, distinguished by **horns and frill**
- Centrosaurinae
	- Centrosaurus - "*pointed lizard*"
	- Styracosayrys - "*spiked lizard*"
	- Pachyrhinosaurus - "*think nosed lizard*"
- Chasmosaurinae
	- Triceratops - "*three horn face*"

| Centrosaurinae                                                | Chasmosaurinae             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| large **nasal horn**<br>or thickened nasal bone called "boss" | prominent **brow horns**   |
| ornamented frill **with long spines**                         | frills lacking long spines |
