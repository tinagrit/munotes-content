## Macronaria
- means "*big noses*"
- **largest** and **heaviest** land animals of all time
- evolutionary novelties
	- short and boxy **skull**
	- large, arched **nares** with thin crest above
	- wide set **hip bones**, wide stance
	- elongated **metacarpals** with reduced manual digits, or none at all

### *Camarasaurus*
- name means "*chambered lizard*"
	- refers to the "air-y" cervical vertebrae with air sacs
- blunt face and **spatulate** teeth
- lived in **North America, 150 Ma, Late Jurassic**


---
## Brachiosauridae
- means "*arm lizard*"
- **giraffe-like** proportions
	- longer forelimbs than rear limbs
- met extinction between end of Jurassic to "mid" Cretaceous

### *Brachiosaurus*
- lived in **North America, 150 Ma, Late Jurassic**, Morrison Formation
- also from the **Golden Age of Dinosaurs**, like the [[1_Sauropods#Diplodocoids|Diplodocoids]]
- short tail
- neck held up high
- tree top browsers, eat things from the top of the tree


---
## Titanosaurs
- **longest** and **heaviest** sauropods of all time
- some members **lost all** manual digits. They walk on their metacarpals
- neck more **in front** than up high
- persisted through the [[1_Sauropods#Diplodocoids|Diplodocoids]] and [[#Brachiosauridae|Brachiosaurids]] extinctions, only sauropods existing after
- barely existing in the Northern Hemisphere, **dominant plant eaters** of the **Southern** Hemisphere
	- Hadrosaurs and Ceratopsians dominate Northern Hemisphere

### *Argentinosaurus* and *Patagotitan*
- lived in **Argentina, 97 Ma, Late Cretaceous**
- no manual digits
- **~35 metres** in length
- **75 tonnes** in weight
- ~5 kg when hatching, and grows up to **40 kg** every day at their peak


---
## Saltasauridae
- smaller in size, **dwarf** sauropods
- covered in **armoured plates**
	- large keeled and spiked osteoderms <12 cm across
	- continuous armour <7 mm across plates

### *Saltasaurus*
- lived in **Argentina, 70 Ma, Late Cretaceous**

### *Alamosaurus*
- lived in **North America, 70 Ma, Late Cretaceous**
	- likely migrated from South America
	- after ~30 million years of absence of sauropods in North America, called the **sauropod hiatus**
