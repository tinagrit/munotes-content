Lecture 24

## Hadrosauridae
- the "*duck bills*"
- highly derived Ornithopod
- really **wide premaxilla** and **predentary**
- **replaced** the [[#Iguanodontidae|Iguanodontians]] by the Late Cretaceous
	- abundant fossils in Hell Creek Formation
	- only outnumbered by ceratopsians
- evolutionary novelties
	- **no manus digit I**, while Iguanadontians have a spiked digit
	- longer **snouts**
	- broad **beeks**, covered in keratin (hence the name *duck bills*)
- **dental battery**, similar to [[1_Sauropods#*Nigersaurus*|Nigersaurus]]
	- opposite **angles** lined up when mouth closes
		- top teeth angled inwards
		- bottom teeth angled outwards
	- teeth surface is **rough and jagged**
	- consists of:
		- **dentine**, the soft part
		- **enamel**, the hard part
	- grinding surface where hard part wears slower

Hadrosaurs are classified into 2 main clades
- Lambeosaurines
- Saurolophines

## Lambeosaurines
- a variety lived in **North America**
- **hollow crests** connected with nasal passages, with U or S shape
	- nasal cavity produces **loud, low bellowing** sounds
	- used for vocal display and communication

### *Parasaurolophus*
- name means "*near crested lizard*"
- lived in **North America, 75 Ma, Late Cretaceous**
- crest grows at ~1 year old, juveniles do not have the large crest

### *Corythosaurus*
- name means "*Corinthian helmet lizard*"
- lived in **North America, 75 Ma, Late Cretaceous**
- large **nasal bone** followed by premaxilla in front/crest

### *Lambrosaurus*
- name means "*Lambe's lizard*"
- lived in **North America, 75 Ma, Late Cretaceous**

### *Olorotitan*
- name means "*swan titan*"
	- reflects its lock neck
- lived in **Eastern Russia, 72-66 Ma, Late Cretaceous**
- a juvenile reaches **1/2** of adult size in **one year**
- only **1/10** juveniles survive their first year

## Saurolophines
- has **solid crests** (not hollow) or **fleshy combs**
- dominated **North America** near the end of Cretaceous

### *Maiasaura*
- name means "*good mother lizard*"
- *Saura* is the **feminine form** of *Saurus*
- evidence of **parental behaviour** and investment
	- as mentioned in [[4_Tracks#Ornithopods|Ornithopods]]
	- juveniles stay with parents for a long time
- has **solid crests**

### *Edmontosaurus*
- name means "*Edmonton lizard*"
- lived in **North America, 66 Ma, Late Cretaceous**
- previously thought to have no crest
	- 2014 discovery found **fleshy comb**
- incredibly **abundant** in **North America**
- failed attack by T-rex
	- evidence of punctured caudal vertebrae matched with T-rex tooth
- is ~2 times **faster** than T-rex, being the same sized
