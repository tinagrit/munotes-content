## Sauropoda
- the "**long neck**" dinosaurs

```
Dinosauria
└── Saurischia
	└── Sauropodomorpha
		└── Sauropoda
```

- evolutionary novelties
	- **pneumatic** (*air passes through*) vertebrae, air sac system
	- giant size
	- long neck/tail
	- small head
- **grows quickly**, full size in 20 years
	- due to bird-like metabolism
- lays eggs in large groups
	- "**nesting ground**" found in *Argentina*
	- eggs buried underground, using the sauropod's **pes**
	- some uses ***volcanic activity*** to keep eggs warm, nest near hot springs, etc.
- walk on thick **pillar-like** legs
	- pedal digits I, II, III have **claws**, rarely on IV, but never on V
	- ungual points **away** from the midline
- very **large manual claw** on digit I
	- for all but most derived Sauropods, i.e. not Titanosaurs
	- Very derived Sauropods **lost all** manual digits. They walk on their metacarpals.
- unique teeth compared to other herbivores
	- either **peg-like** or **spatulate**
	- not for chewing, just to bring in to mouth

> [!tip] Note
> The ***Barapasaurus*** (*big leg lizard*) is a basal sauropod in the Early Jurassic from India.

## Diplodocoids
- means "double beam"
	- refers to its **chevrons** in the caudal vertebrae
	- looking like "skis"
- evolutionary novelties
	- relatively light
	- long slender skull
		- **nares** dorsally located, above the antorbital fenestra
	- slender **peg-like** **teeth**
	- extremely long, **whip-like tails**
		- used for communication
		- some with 80+ caudal vertebrae

> [!tip] Note
> The *Diplodocoids* and *Macronarians* form the **Golden Age of Dinosaurs**, found in North America's **Morrison** Formation in the **Late Jurassic**.

### *Diplodocus*
- lived in **North America, 150 Ma, Late Jurassic**, Morrison Formation
- long skull
- ~33m in length

### *Amargasaurus*
- lived in **Argentina, 125 Ma, Early Cretaceous**
- is a **"dwarf"** sauropod, ~9-10 metre long with shorter neck and tail
- very **large neural spines** on top of the vertebrae

### *Nigersaurus*
- lived in **Niger, Africa, 110 Ma, Early Cretaceous**
- is also a **dwarf** sauropod
- very **unique** skull
	- wide face
- very tightly packed **dental battery**
	- teeth lined up at the front instead of wrapping around
	- eats things off the ground, a **fern mower**
