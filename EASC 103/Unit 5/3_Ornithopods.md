## Ornithischia
- means "*bird hipped*"

```
Dinosauria
└── Ornithischia
```

- "**meaty**" dinosaurs
- plant eaters
- evolutionary novelties
	- toothless **predentary**
		- no saurischians have predentary
	- ossified **tendons** on the **dorsal vertebrae**
		- stiff back to support its weight, bones aren't hollow
		- some saurischians have tendons along the tail, not back
	- **backward** directed **pubis**
		- similar to Paraves
		- gives more space for the **abdomen**
		- plant eaters eat lots of plants

### Ornithopods
- means "*bird feet*"

```
Dinosauria
└── Ornithischia
	└── Neornithischia
		└── Ornithopoda
```

- in the basal/primitive members
	- are **bipeds**
	- have **teeth** in the **premaxilla**
	- as old as **Middle Jurassic**
- more derived ones are **facultative bipeds**
- evolutionary novelties
	- **no armour**
		- no defensive horns or spikes
	- horny **beak** with thick keratin cover
	- no mandibular fenestra
	- has **cranial kinesis**
		- joints in the skull allowing cranium to **slide** forward and outwards
		- flexes skull and **rubs teeth** every time opening and closing mouth
		- **grinds food** that way, no need to chew
- have **high EQs**
	- shows evidence of parental behaviour and investment
	- juveniles stay with parents for a long time

> [!tip] Note
> **Maiasaura**, a hadrosaurid ornithopod, means "*good mother lizard*".
> 
> *Saura* is the feminine form of *Saurus*

## Iguanodontidae
- long **snouts**
- widened **toothless premaxilla**
- are **facultative bipeds**

### *Iguanodon*
- name means "*iguana tooth*"
- lived in **Europe, 125 Ma, Early Cretaceous**, same time as [[1_Non-Coelurosaur Theropods#*Baryonyx*|Baryonyx]]
- one of the first dinosaurs to be named and described (1825) by **Richard Owen**
- in the **manus**:
	- has digit I **spike**
	- digits II, III, IV attached together, in a "mit"
	- has **prehensile** (*wrap around things*) digit V
