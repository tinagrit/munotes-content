- Covers sections 2.7-2.11

The ***flat*** part of the hockey stick. For ~800 years, there was almost **no growth** in income or population.

## The Malthusian Model

This model regarding food production requires 2 key **assumptions**:
- The **production function** has a diminishing **average product** of labour (how much goods can be made per farmer)
	- Average product of labour declines with population
	$\displaystyle\text{average product of labour}=\frac{\text{total product}}{\text{number of farmers}}$

- Population increases when the average product **exceeds subsistence** (*equilibrium*). Level of subsistence is constant in the world. Producing more than subsistence, population increase.
	- As societies become more prosperous and enjoy more income, more births will happen

He believes that:
- Technological improvements can **temporarily increase the average product** (to go beyond subsistence), but only until the average product falls back to equilibrium.

### The Production Function

$Y$ (what the firm the producing) $=f(x$ (whatever the firm needs to produce) $)$

This can also be expressed with a table or a figure:

> This is not linear. For example, in a restaurant, doubling the number of chefs does not double the amount of food produced.

- At 800 farmers, the total product is 500,000 kg
	- The average product of labour is $\frac{500,000}{800}=625$ kg
- At 1600 (double) farmers, the total product is 732,000 kg
	- The average product of labour is $\frac{732,000}{1,600}=458$ kg

This concave production function generates a **diminishing** average product of labour.

A straight line drawn from the *origin* to a point will show the **average product of labour**. A steeper line means a more productive point.

> A function is a concave function if a straight line drawn from any two points on the curve is always below the curve.

Average product diminishes due to:
- More labour is put into a **fixed amount of land**, reducing productivity.
- There is more land theoretically, but the cultivated land is limited.

## Effect of technological progress

Malthus believes that the *"too many cooks in the kitchen"* problem will come back **every time** population rises, and that we can **never escape this trap**. *(Malthusian trap / Malthus' Law / Iron law of wages)*

In addition to the 2 key assumptions [[#The Malthusian Model]], **one more** condition is required to stay in the trap:
- An **absence of big improvements** in technology to offset the diminishing average product of labour
	- The *permanent technological revolution* [[Inequality#The Permanent Technological Revolution]] meant that this condition **no longer holds** and thus the reason Britain escaped the Malthusian trap

The technological progress **proceeded faster** than population growth. 
- Also due to improvements in sanitation and medicine in the 19th century
- Contraception and family planning slowed it down in the 20th century
