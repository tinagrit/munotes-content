## Multiple equilibria

- Having **multiple** best options (*Nash equilibria)
- Single equilibrium is due to both players having a *dominant strategy*.
- *Example*: Driving on the left/right
	- People in some countries drive on the left
	- Both conventions are Nash equilibria. If others drive on the left, you drive on the left![[Screenshot 2024-10-31 at 12.40.32 PM.png]]
	- Each player's best response is to copy each other	
- *Example*: Crop choice, redux![[Screenshot 2024-10-31 at 12.43.33 PM.png]]
