## Social dilemmas

- Sometimes self-interested individuals generate 
	- **good** outcomes. ***"invisible hand"***
	- **bad** outcomes. ***"Tragedy of the commons, prisoner's dilemma"***
- Can sometimes be resolved by
	- social **preferences**, eg. *altruism*, *reciprocity*, *spite*
	- **repetition** that harnesses reciprocity
		- keep playing the same game; see **repercussions** of the results; change behaviour
		- for example, not believing in climate change â†’ repeated repercussions such as *natural disasters*
	- institutions that **punish** bad behaviour
		- firms hit with a huge tax for undesirable actions, eg. *carbon*

## Economic experiments

- is conducted to ***understand people more***.
- ***cannot*** be done on entire economies
- ***lab experiments*** used to test theories
- investigate social dilemmas
	- for example, [[#Public goods game]]

> Experiments shed light on how [[#Social dilemmas|social dilemmas]] can be resolved by social preferences, repetition, and punishment.

## Public goods (and bads)

### What are public goods?

- has to be **non-excludable**, meaning that they benefit everyone
- has to be **non-rival**, meaning that when someone uses it, it won't diminish the benefit to others. 
	- (eg. *solar eclipse: you seeing a solar eclipse doesn't lessen the ability of your neighbour to do so*)

- one of 4 types of goods, other types of goods include: **private good** *(rival and excludable)*, **scarce public good** eg. toll roads *(non-rival and excludable)*, **common-pool resources** eg. fish in a lake *(rival and non-excludable)*.

- Public goods are **susceptible to free riding** (*taking advantage*)
	- **Self-interested** people tend to **under-contribute** to public goods
	- eg. A person who won't help in a group project is a ***free rider*** taking advantage of everyone else since grades will be shared


### Public goods game

- Four farmers consider contributing to an irrigation project
	- The ***private cost*** of contributing is $10 (it costs $10 to enter)
	- The ***benefit*** of contributing is $8 to each farmer
	- The ***social benefit*** of contributing is $4*\$8=\$32$
		- If everyone contributes, they get $32 extra


Chart of Kim's payoff based on his contribution choice:

![[Screenshot 2024-10-10 at 1.03.11 PM.png]]


- When there are **no other** players
	- If she contributes, she pays $\$10$ and gets $\$8$ back
	- If she doesn't contribute, nothing is done

- When there are **1** **other** player
	- If she contributes, she pays $\$10$ and gets $2*\$8=\$16$ back
		- Her payoff is $\$16-\$10=\$6$
	- If she doesn't contribute, she doesn't pay and gets $1*\$8=\$8$ back

- When there are **2** **other** player
	- If she contributes, she pays $\$10$ and gets $3*\$8=\$24$ back
		- Her payoff is $\$24-\$10=\$14$
	- If she doesn't contribute, she doesn't pay and gets $2*\$8=\$16$ back

Assuming **everyone else contributes**, Kim would always profit more by **not contributing**.
- This incentivizes Kim to **free ride**, making it her dominant strategy.

This is a **social dilemma** because
- If everyone **free rides**, then nobody gets anything
- If everyone **contributes**, then they each get $4*\$8=\$32-\$10=\$22$.
	- This is the ***best case for societal benefits***, however, free riding is incentivized for self-interested individuals.
	- When people pursue their self interests, they are making it ***worse for themselves***.

This is why social dilemmas **needs to be resolved** because they make our progress ***stuck behind*** by people pursuing their own self interests, when the world can be better if everyone pursues the social optimum.


### Elinor Ostrom (1933-2012)

- claimed that resolving social dilemmas is ***not impossible*** and made a roadmap/law
- distinguished between [[#What are public goods?|common-pool resources]] (*rival and non-excludable*) and ***common property resources*** (*goods managed by a community*)
- Nobel prize in economics for her studies of how communities can **use common resources** without succumbing to the tragedy of the commons
	- getting individuals to **cooperate or participate** in a project that generates mutual benefits


### Game outcome

- Game played in class, rules:
	- groups of 4
	- each player receives $20 each round
	- every $1 contributed leads to a $0.40 return for ***all*** 4 players


#### One shot game

- Each player's dominant strategy and the Nash equilibrium is to **not contribute**
- The average payoff at the Nash equilibrium is $\$20$
- The average payoff at the social optimum is $4*\$20*0.40=\$32$

#### Repeated game

- Life is **not** a one shot game
- In repeated game, players are incentivized to **cooperate today** and **encourage** others to cooperate in the future
- *Tit-for-tat* strategy performs well (play whatever opponent played earlier)
- Raises contributions **initially** compared to one shot
- Contributions **fall** in later rounds
	- When someone starts free riding, I'm going to free ride ***myself***
	- Players become more ***individulistic*** as the game progresses

![[Screenshot 2024-10-10 at 1.30.39 PM.png]]

#### Punishment allowed

- You can pay $1 to subtract $3 from someone else
- Equivalent to **institutions** enforcing punishment
- Peer punishment keeps the contributions consistently high

- Subjects punish low contributors since
	- they are driven by **social preferences** to enforce social norms
	- they **benefit** from punishing if it raises contributions

![[Screenshot 2024-10-10 at 1.30.50 PM.png]]


$\therefore$  a combination of [[#Social dilemmas|social preferences, repetition, punishment]] generates high contributions

> Government punishes bad behaviour to maintain contributions (eg. evading taxes)

---

## Sharing economic rents

- **Mutual gains** from cooperation (*Invisible hand*, *Prisoners' dilemma*, *Public goods*)
- People commonly attempt to **negotiate a cooperative outcome** (*Labour unions*, *Carbon tax*)
	- Federal carbon is generally a *good* thing but politics make it sound like it's *bad*. If it is repealed in the next election, our future generations will *pay the price*
- Sometimes, negotiations break down when an actor believes the mutual gains are **shared unfairly** (*strikes*)


### Ultimatum game 

- **One shot** sequential game
- Two players agree on how to **split $100**
- The ***proposer*** offer the responder ***between*** $1 - $100 (*Take it or leave it*)
- The responder can
	- **accept** the offer
	- **reject** the offer (*no one earns* anything)

| $\text{proposer}\backslash\text{responder}$ |        Accept        |       Reject       |
| :-----------------------------------------: | :------------------: | :----------------: |
|                    $\$0$                    | $100\backslash0$<br> |   $0\backslash0$   |
|                   $\$10$                    | $90\backslash10$<br> | $0\backslash0$<br> |
|                   $\$20$                    | $80\backslash20$<br> | $0\backslash0$<br> |
|                   $\$30$                    | $70\backslash30$<br> | $0\backslash0$<br> |
|                   $\$40$                    | $60\backslash40$<br> | $0\backslash0$<br> |
|                   $\$50$                    | $50\backslash50$<br> | $0\backslash0$<br> |
|                   $\$60$                    | $40\backslash60$<br> | $0\backslash0$<br> |
|                   $\$70$                    | $30\backslash70$<br> | $0\backslash0$<br> |
|                   $\$80$                    | $20\backslash80$<br> | $0\backslash0$<br> |
|                   $\$90$                    | $10\backslash90$<br> | $0\backslash0$<br> |
|                   $\$100$                   | $0\backslash100$<br> | $0\backslash0$<br> |

- The proposer would want the responder to **accept** the offer.
- If they offer $\$10$, the responder would choose $10 over $0.

- The Nash equilibrium is then at $\$10$ ($90\backslash10$)

> The $\$10$ offer will maximize your earning and incentivizes the responder to accept.
> The Nash equilibrium **doesn't go to show** what will happen in a real experiment.
> - For example, the responder may choose to reject anything below $50


So far, we have analyzed **simultaneous games**, however, the game is a **sequential game**.
- One player has to start and the next player will be waiting for the first transaction to complete

The order matters, and the sequence is shown in **the game tree**.

![[Screenshot 2024-10-10 at 1.58.12 PM.png]]


> Before 2023, Vancouver real estate realtors were allowed to hide evidence of property biddings.
> If a house is listed for $1.5 million, the realtor would go and say that someone else has bided for $2 million and provide no evidence. If you really like the house, you would step up and also pay $2 million.
> This is a **take it or leave it** scenario.


#### Cultural differences
When people of different cultures were asked the same question, results varied.

![[Screenshot 2024-10-10 at 2.07.09 PM.png]]

- No one accepts $0
- Low ball offers like $10 and $20 are more likely to be accepted by ***US students than Kenyan farmers***.
	- More than half of US students ***take*** the low $10 offer
	- For farmers, offers lower than $30 are not as acceptable
- It is a 100% guaranteed acceptance when $50 is offered

> This is not a measure of who needs money more.
> $10 is a lot of students, but comparing to Kenya's GDP, $10 USD means a lot for its farmers.


![[Screenshot 2024-10-10 at 2.14.11 PM.png]]

This chart shows **all responses**, including the accepted and rejected offers.
- This demonstrates that Kenyan proposers are **maximizing** their expected payoff:
		$E(o_{30})=0.52*\$70=\$36$
		$E(o_{40})=0.96*\$60=\$58$
		$E(o_{50})=1.00*\$50=\$50$
  which is why the Kenyan bar peaks at $40


#### Competition

- A 2nd responder is added who can **accept any offer rejected** by the 1st responder
- Responders are more likely to **accept low offers**
- Shows that small changes in **rules (*institutions*)**

> Back to the Vancouver example, people would accept an expensive offer for a house if they knew that there was a second person behind them waiting to take the offer if rejected.
> Before 2023, the "**second person behind**" didn't have to be disclosed.



### Field experiments

- Parents are sometimes late to pick up their children from school, which is costly to the school
- A $3 fine per day was experimented enforceable to late parents
- The number of parents arriving late turned out to **go up significantly**
	- Parents **feel better** paying off the late fine than feeling **guilty** arriving late
- This crowded out **social preferences**
