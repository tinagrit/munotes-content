## Q1

| $\text{row}\backslash\text{column}$ | Cooperate        | Defect          |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Cooperate                           | $10\backslash10$ | $0\backslash14$ |
| Defect                              | $14\backslash0$  | $2\backslash2$  |
Defecting will ***always*** give you rewards, regardless of what the other agent chooses to do. 

The strategy to play is, therefore, to have both agents **defect**.

However, this is not efficient. 

| $\text{row}\backslash\text{column}$ | Cooperate        | Defect          |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Cooperate                           | $15\backslash15$ | $7\backslash14$ |
| Defect                              | $14\backslash7$  | $3\backslash3$  |
This time, **cooperating** will always give rewards, regardless of what the other agent chooses.

There is more **incentive** to cooperate than to defect.
This outcome is efficient.


## Q2

| $\text{row}\backslash\text{column}$ | Sit              | Stand           |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Sit                                 | $10\backslash10$ | $3\backslash15$ |
| Stand                               | $15\backslash3$  | $5\backslash5$  |
The Nash equilibrium is to **stand**.
The social optimum is to **sit**.

Everyone would stand at the concert while they should all be sitting.


## Q3

| $\text{Arkady}\backslash\text{Barbara}$ | Corn             | Tomatoes         |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Corn                                    | $1\backslash2.5$ | $2\backslash2$   |
| Tomatoes                                | $4\backslash4$   | $2.5\backslash1$ |
Arkady will always choose **tomatoes**
Barb will always choose **corn**

The Nash equilibrium and social optimum are $\text{Tomatoes}\backslash\text{Corn}$



## Game of chicken

| $\text{row}\backslash\text{column}$ | Swerve          | Straight         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Swerve                              | $0\backslash0$  | $-1\backslash1$  |
| Straight                            | $1\backslash-1$ | $-2\backslash-2$ |
