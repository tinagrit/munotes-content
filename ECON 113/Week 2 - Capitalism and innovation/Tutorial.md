## Question 1

| Production time required | Country A | Country B |
| ------------------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Clothing                 | 4 hrs     | 2 hrs     |
| Food                     | 4 hrs     | 5 hrs     |

### Absolute advantage

- **Country B has the absolute advantage in producing clothing**
- **Country A has the absolute advantage in producing food**

> **Opportunity cost** compares the next best option an entity can choose.
> What could it have earned if it had done this?

### Comparative advantage

Opportunity cost of clothing
- For country A, $\dfrac{4}{4}=1$
	- For every unit dedicated to producing clothes, it is giving up 1 unit of food
- For country B,  $\dfrac{2}{5}=0.4$
	- For every unit dedicated to producing clothes, it is giving up 0.4 units of food
- **Country B has the comparative advantage in clothing**

Opportunity cost of food
- For country A, $\dfrac{4}{4}=1$ 
	- For every unit dedicated to producing food, it is giving up 1 unit of clothes
- For country B, $\dfrac{5}{2}=2.5$
	- For every unit dedicated to producing food, it is giving up 2.5 units of clothes
- **Country A has the comparative advantage in food**

### Specialization

Since country A has both advantages in food, it should **specialize in food**
Since country B has both advantages in clothing, it should **specialize in clothing**

Survivability can be ensured by having countries A and B **trade with each other** since each country needs both goods to survive.

## Question 2

$f(\text{labour},\text{capital})$ = $\text{wage}*\text{labour} + \text{price}*\text{capital}$

$C$ = $wL + pK$
the **Isocost function**

$500=5*L+1*K$

```desmos-graph
left=-50; right=150;
top=600; bottom=-50;
---
500=5x+y
```

$m=\dfrac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=-\dfrac{500}{100}=-5$

## Question 3

```desmos-graph
left=0; right=40;
top=15; bottom=0;
---

(15,9)|label:A|red
x=15|y>9|red|dashed
y=9|x>15|red|dashed

(12,5)|label:B|blue
x=12|y>5|blue|dashed
y=5|x>12|blue|dashed

(8,11)|label:C|green
x=8|y>11|green|dashed
y=11|x>8|green|dashed

(9,13)|label:D|orange
x=9|y>13|orange|dashed
y=13|x>9|orange|dashed

(30,3)|label:E|purple
x=30|y>3|purple|dashed
y=3|x>30|purple|dashed
```

- C dominates D
- B dominates A
- E dominates nothing

## Question 4

$C$ = $wL + pK$

$C-wL$ = $pK$

$K$=$\dfrac{C-wL}{p}$ (isocost in terms of capital)

$1,500$ = $45*30+20k$
