## Capitalism

The hockey stick shape in labour productivity and income (refer to [[Inequality#Income over time]]) might be explained by the **rise of capitalism**.

This can also be caused by the **rise of free speech and democracy** at about the same time as the rise of capitalism. Capitalism and growth are correlation, not causation. 

>Hockey sticks, however, **don't apply to inequality**. It got better in the past 100 years. It has risen since 1980, especially in the US due to **“megafirms”**

### What is capitalism?
- an economic system
- Characterized by a new **combination of *three* institutions** built around
	- Private property (ability to buy a piece of land)
	- Markets (formal trade)
	- Firms (specialized in making things)

>Even capitalist economies rely on non-capitalist institutions (eg. families, government)

Definitions can **never be 100% precise** in the social sciences, unlike in the natural sciences. 
- In science, a statement that X causes Y can be proved by performing experiments to gather evidence
- This can't be done in economics since we can't perform large scale experiments on entire populations

It is **hard to identify** a capitalist economic system using easy to measure physical characteristics.
- China and the US are **both** capitalist economies. They only differ in how much the government would influence it.

Capitalism **needs all three pillars** (institutions) to function as a capitalist economic system
- Most production takes place in firms.
- Inputs and outputs are private property.
- Firms sell outputs on markets.
- Capital goods are privately owned.
- Power is concentrated in the hands of owners and managers, but it is limited by competition with other firms.

### Other economic systems
Including but not limited to:
- slavery
- feudalism
- family-based production
- socialism

>Capitalism has a lot of faults. *There is no one perfect system*, but it has been the best system by far.

## Living standards

- **Technology**
	- firms *(third pillar of capitalism, see [[#What is capitalism?]])* don't directly cause technological change
	- firms competing with each other are incentivized to develop new and more productive technologies
		- for firms to survive, they have to be good
	- investing in capital goods beyond reach of small-scale family enterprises
- **Specialization**
	- firms and markets growth/expansion employ a lot of workers
	- someone is better at something than others
	- allowing unprecedented division of labour

### Specialization
Ideas attributed to ***Adam Smith***.
- student of philosophy, *father of economics*
- thinks that free markets generate prosperity, while arguing for governments to provide defence, justice, education, and infrastructure

People are more productive when they **focus on a limited range** of activities
- People acquire **different skills** and abilities to produce things
- **Producing things at large** (*economy of scale*) is more cost-effective

> People, however, can only specialize when they **have a way to acquire** the other goods they need.
> 	ex. Lawyers are only comfortable specializing in laws because there are **already** doctors and engineers around

Raises the question of
- How are the goods and services **distributed** from the producer to the final user?
	- This naturally happens due to people **wanting to survive** and thrive (*free market*)

> Free market allows for more productivity and harmony, but it creates problems such as inequality (see [[Inequality]])


### Example
In a world of two people, Greta and Carlos, both need wheat and apples to survive.

|        | Production yield if dedicated to one good |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Greta  | 1,250 apples or 50 tonnes of wheat        |
| Carlos | 1,000 apples or 20 tonnes of wheat        |
While Greta has **absolute advantage** in producing both crops, she would produce
- 150% more wheat
- 25% more apple

Greta has a **comparative advantage** producing wheat since:
- For Greta to produce 1 ton of wheat, she would have to give up $\frac{1,250}{50}=25$ apples (*opportunity cost*)
- For Carlos to produce 1 ton of wheat, her opportunity cost is $\frac{1,000}{20}=50$ apples
- Greta has a **lower** opportunity cost

Carlos, however, has a **comparative advantage** producing apples:
- For Greta to produce 1 apple, her opportunity cost is $\frac{50}{1,250}=0.04$ tonnes of wheat
- For Carlos to produce 1 apple, her opportunity cost is $\frac{20}{1,000}=0.02$ tonnes of wheat
- Carlos has a **lower** opportunity cost

#### Economy with specialization

|           |            | Self-sufficiency | Specialization |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Greta     | Apples     | 500              | -              |
|           | Wheat      | 30               | 50             |
| Carlos    | Apples     | 300              | 1,000          |
|           | Wheat      | 14               | -              |
| **Total** | **Apples** | **800**          | **1,000**      |
|           | **Wheat**  | **44**           | **50**         |
Specialization allows for **more** to be produced.
- Since Greta and Carlos need both apples and wheat to survive, they will trade
- Specialization **benefits everyone**


### Where capitalism fails
Capitalism fails to raise living standards when:
- private properties are **not secure**
- markets are **not competitive**
- firms are owned or managed by people with **government connection**
