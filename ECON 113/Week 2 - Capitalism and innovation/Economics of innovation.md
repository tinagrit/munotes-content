## The Rapid Growth
Hockey sticks *(see [[Inequality#Income over time]] and [[Capitalism as an economic system#Capitalism]])* in income and living standards are largely due to **technological progress**.

## A model of innovation
Explaining how capitalism promotes innovation and technological progress is built on these ideas:
- ***Ceteris paribus*** -- holding other things constant
- **Incentives matter** -- firms are made to maximize profits
- **Relative prices** -- comparing alternatives
- **Economic rents** -- adoption of new technologies for better profits

### Economic models
- abstract from **reality**
- equilibrium is a result of a model; an outcome
- presented verbally, mathematically, or graphically
- summarizes what happens in an economy, illustrating **the big picture**
- clear, accurate, and useful

### Choice of technology
This ***PPF* chart** (Production Possibility Frontier) shows technologies for producing 100 metres of cloth.

Each technology requires a different number of workers and different amount of coal. 
- A technology **dominates** another technology if it requires less of at least one input, and no more of any input
	- A dominates C because it requires less input

Drawing a space for everything that requires less input will show domination

This shows that
- A dominates C
- B dominates D
- E dominates nothing

Firms' choices will depends on the **price** **of coal** vs. the **price** **of labour**.

#### With expensive coal
Assuming wage is $10 and coal is $20 per tonne

| Technology | Workers | Coal | Total cost |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- | ---------- |
| A          | 1       | 6    | $130       |
| **B**          | **4**       | **2**    | **$80**        |
| E          | 10      | 1    | $120       |
While B is very **labour intense**, it is the cheapest option.

A line of **isocost** can be drawn on the same chart. This can be calculated with:
 
- $(\text{wage}*\text{labour})+(\text{price}*\text{coal})=80$
- $(10*\text{labour})+(20*\text{coal})=80$
- $(20*\text{coal})=80-(10*\text{labour})$
- $\text{coal}$ (y-axis) $=\dfrac{80-(10*\text{labour})}{20}$
- $\text{coal}$ (y-axis) $=4-(\dfrac{1}{2}*\text{labour})$
- Slope of **isocost line** is $\dfrac{1}{2}$

Now, everything **above the line costs more** than $80, and everything below the line costs less than $80.

#### With cheap coal
During Britain's industrial revolution, prices of coal dropped below wages.
Assuming wage is $10 and coal is $5 per tonne.

| Technology | Workers | Coal | Total cost |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- | ---------- |
| **A**          | **1**       | **6**    | **$40**        |
| B          | 4       | 2    | $50        |
| E          | 10      | 1    | $105       |
A is now the cheapest option.

The same calculation can be done to produce the isocost slope of $-2$

This chart is now much steeper.

#### Data
Real data from the 1700s shows that the model explains the industrial revolution in Britain.

Wages in English went way over the cost of capital and above all other countries.

### Creative destruction
If people stuck with technology B, the price of cloth will be $50, while moving to A will only cost $40.
- This means that the **innovation rent** of switching is $10
- In the long run, all firms will adopt the new technology and the price of cloth will drop. 
- This process is called **creative destruction**, emphasized by Joseph Schumpeter

New innovations result in creative destruction where they diffuse throughout the economy. 
- Firms that don't adopt new technologies **will go bankrupt**
- ex. The invention of the spinning mule ultimately put spinsters and spinning wheels out of work

Creative destruction is seen today in:
- Driverless cars replacing taxis
- Self-checkout replacing cashiers
- eBooks replacing professors

Whether it is good or not is a **philosophical question**
- Cabbies protest against Uber
- People worry that new technology may lead to inhumane outcomes.
