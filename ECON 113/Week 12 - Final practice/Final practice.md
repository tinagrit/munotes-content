## 1)
- WTP
	- Nicola's WTP is $3
	- Alexander's WTP is $1
	- Nicola values apples more than Alexander
- Scenario A
	- If apples were $3
	- Alexander is worse off since he would be forced to pay $3
- Scenario B
	- If apples were $1
	- Nicola is worse off since he would be forced to *sell* for less than what he values
- Scenario C
	- If apples were $2
	- Nicola is worse off
	- Alexandra is worse off
- **Scenario D**
	- If apples were $2
	- Alexandra sells it for more than what he values
	- Nicola buys it for less than what he values

## 2)
- Scenario A is *efficient*
	- Nicola is neutral while Alexander is better off
- Scenario B
	- Both gets surplus
- **Scenario C**
	- Both are worse off

## 3)
At $0.7, quantity demanded = supplied

## 4)
At $0.6, there is more demand than supply

## 5)
At $0.8, quantity supplied exceeds demand by 25

## 6)
- Joe's WTP 
	- $2 for the first cup
	- $1.2 for second
	- $1 for third
	- $0.8 for fourth
- Scenario A
	- 3 cups WTP = $2+1.2+1=4.2$
	- Actual price = $1 \times 3=3$
	- Consumer surplus = $4.2-3=1.2$
- **Scenario C**
	- 2 cups WTP = $2+1.2=3.2$
	- Actual price = $1.1 \times 2=2.2$
	- Consumer surplus = $3.2-2.2=1$

## 7)
- Cost = $P_L \cdot L + P_C \cdot C$
- Cost = $L+C$
- Technology C is cheapest

## 8)
- Technology A is cheapest

## 9)
- Technology D is cheapest

## 10)
- the frontier itself moves

## 11)
At price $4.5 there is more demand than supply
$100-40=60$

## 12)
- At $5, shortage becomes 30 million gallons (80-50)
- 30 million gallons added to market
- There is no longer a shortage

## 13)
- question asking how to increase area
- new technology will expand the feasible frontier and increase the area

## 14)
- At F, MRT $\not =$ MRS

## 15)
- A is false because coercion (green line) will always give him more surplus
- B is false because Bruno gets 4.5, not 5
- **C is true** because her reservation is at 4.5

## 16) skip

## 17)
- confess is the dominant strategy/nash equilibrium

## 18) skip

## 19)
- **A is true** since $2.5 \times 26 = 6,500$

## 20) skip

## Question 1 skip

## Question 2
- **a)**
	- $I=P\times Q$
	- $I=P^*\times Q^*$
	- $I=\$4 \times 400,000$
	- $I=\$1,600,000$
- **b)**
	- at $2.00
	- $D=600,000$ gallons
	- $S=150,000$ gallons
- **c)**
	- there will be a **supply shortage**
	- of $600,000-150,000=450,000$ gallons
- **d)**
	- there will be a **demand surplus**
	- of $600,000-150,000=450,000$ gallons
- **e)**
	- At $2.00, there is only 150,000 gallons supplied
	- DWL = area of triangle
	- $=\frac{1}{2}bh$
	- $=\frac{1}{2}(6-2)(400-150)$
	- $=\frac{1}{2}(4)(250)$
	- $=500$
