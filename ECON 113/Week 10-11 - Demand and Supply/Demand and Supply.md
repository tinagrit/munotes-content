covers sections 8.0-8.6 of CORE

- **Price-setting firms** choose the price-quantity combination that maximizes profits
	- Monopolistic firms
- **Price-taking firms** take the price as given (no control over price) and choose the quantity that maximizes profits.
	- Competitive firms (this unit)


## Demand curve

![[Screenshot 2024-11-21 at 12.21.48 AM.png]]

The **demand curve** 
- shows the consumer's **willingness to pay** (WTP) / **Marginal benefit** (MB)
- is generally **downward sloping**
	- *Law of Demand*: demand for a product is inversely related to its price
	- The lower the price, the greater the demand
- can be written in relation (isolate equation) to price $P$ (WTP) or to quantity $Q$

### Demand for used textbooks

![[Screenshot 2024-11-21 at 12.21.48 AM 1.png]]

Students' WTP depends on:
- how **interested** they are in the subject
- how **useful** they think the textbook will be
- how much **money** they (or their parents) have

## Supply curve

The **supply curve**
- shows the firms' **Willingness to Accept** (WTA) / **Marginal cost** (MC)
- is generally **upward sloping**
	- the higher the price a unit can be sold, the more it will be produced

### Supply for used textbooks

The supply depends on the sellers' WTA

Sellers are lined up from those with the lowest **reservation price** to those with the highest
- 20th seller is WTA $7
- At a price of $10, 32 books will be supplied


## The Market Equilibrium

**Equilibrium** -- the condition that exists when 
- quantity supplied and demanded are **equal**.
	- WTP = WTA
- there is **no tendency / incentive** for price to change by any individual or firm
- driven by **competition**
	- the *competitive equilibrium*, *redux*
- Also a *Nash equilibrium*

| Quantity **demanded exceeds** quantity supplied                                 | Quantity **supplied exceeds** quantity demanded                                 |
| At $1.75, 50,000 bushels of soybeans are demanded, but only 25,000 is supplied. | At $3.00, 65,000 bushels of soybeans are supplied, but only 25,000 is demanded. |
| Price is **too low**                                                            | Price is **too high**                                                           |
| Price tends to **rise**                                                         | Price tends to **fall**                                                         |
Note: *demand and supply colours are swapped in the table*.

## Gains from trade

![[Screenshot 2024-11-21 at 1.04.14 AM.png]]

When the price is set at A, everyone to the left of A benefits.
- **Consumer surplus** -- total difference between the maximum amount of a person's WTP (reservation) and the current market price
	- How much surplus?: area of the red
- **Producer surplus** -- total difference between the cost of production (reservation) and the current market price
	- How much surplus?: area of the blue
- **Welfare** = Consumer surplus + Producer surplus

At the competitive equilibrium, the **area of welfare is maximized**, and therefore efficient.
- Monopolies cause the supply (blue line) to go up, reducing welfare at the consumer surplus' cost.

All gains from trades (entire area) are **exhausted** when firms are competitive, or price takers.

### Deadweight loss
However, when firms are price setters (monopolies), not all gains are used due to **deadweight loss**.

![[Screenshot 2024-11-21 at 1.45.27 PM.png]]

Deadweight loss (DWL) is **wasted surplus** for everyone, both the producer and consumer.

On the left, there is an **underproduction**
- Price setters decide to produce *less than* at the equilibrium
- Only people who are willing to pay more than $2.5 gets the surplus.
- People in the DWL are **excluded**
- i.e. market during COVID

On the right, an **overproduction** also creates a DWL.
- No one is willing to pay the price that is a surplus for the firm


### Efficiency
- The **competitive market** is efficient
	- all participants are **price takers**. $P=MC$
	- The exchange of goods and money governed by a complete contract between buyer and seller
	- No effect on others

- The competitive market can *sometimes* **not be fair**
	- i.e. **Gasoline** is priced worldwide
		- According to the competitive market, gas prices in lower income countries should equal to gas prices in Canada
		- However, subsidies are in place for lower income countries
		- Government intervenes to become price setters
	- In **rental markets**
		- Rental markets are *competitive in nature*
		- However, in Vancouver, rent *increases are capped* to protect the consumer surplus
