## The change in economy

### Income in the 14th century
- **Bengal** (today’s Bangladesh) was the richest country *Muhammad Ibn Battuta* had ever seen due to abundance of rice
- Bangladesh is now a relatively **poor country**.

> Economy continues to change

### Income over time
Figure of income levels over time resembles a hockey stick which also appears in other places (eg. climate, speed of information travel)

*The US is currently the richest due to manufacturing*

This chart exists because of *Angus Maddison* who went and collected historical data allowing models to be made

> Data is more important than models. Economists learn from the past and use data to apply.

## Measuring living standards

- **GDP** *(gross domestic product)* measures the size of an economy
	- Market value of all goods produced in a country
	- Total income earned within a country

- **GDP per capita** is the average income per person
	- Generally used to measure the wealth of a country. The higher the richer.
	- Canada (2022) > $54,000 USD

- **Disposable income** is the amount of money an individual can spend
	- How much money a person can spend without going into debt
	- Wages + Profit + Rent + Interest + Transfers – Taxes

### Issues with GDP
- GDP doesn’t measure other living factors (eg. crime rate, pollution)
	- The US has a high GDP. Kennedy questions if GDP is a good measure of wellbeing.
	- Having high crime rates is due to having higher inequality.

## Distribution of income

Figure of the distribution of income
- Countries are arranged according to GDP per capita from left to right
- The width of each bar represents the population
- There are 10 bars for each country

The **skyscrapers** (*top 10%*) show the inequality of income distribution. Norway, ranking second in GDP per capita doesn't have a tall skyscraper due to a more even income distribution.

## Measuring economic growth

$\text{growth rate} = \dfrac{\text{change in GDP}}{\text{original GDP}}$
where the change in GDP is calculated by the new GDP subtracted by the original GDP

### The Industrial Revolution
- **Biggest leap** in technological progress in modern history
- Started specifically in Britain in the middle of the 18th century
- Britain’s **GDP exploded** after this period
- Innovations were created for
	- Textiles
	- Energy
	- Transportation (steam engine)

### The Permanent Technological Revolution
- **Technology** *(production function)* are sets of inputs (materials, machinery, labour) to produce an output
- Allows for less labour needed to produce the same output

Technological progress was **very slow** for millennia, until the industrial revolution, which was the corner of the "hockey stick". This goes to show that living standards **did not grow** in any substantial way for a very long time.

#### The Washing Machine
Washing machines are a great example of the technological revolution. They allowed more people, *particularly women*, to work. Workforce **grew by 40%** since the invention.
