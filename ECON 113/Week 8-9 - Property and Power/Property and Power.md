- covers sections 5.0-5.11 of CORE
- Skip 5.12-5.14

## Institutions

- **rules/contract** of the game
- written and unwritten rules that govern how people interact in joint projects and how products are distributed
	- constraints on behaviour
	- incentives

> [!example] 
> For example, in the ultimatum game, institutions determine:
> - how the game is played
> - the size of the pie
> - bargaining power over how the pie is divided


## Power

- Determined by **institutions**
- People's **ability** **in opposition** to the interests of others
- For **voluntary** economic interaction, power:
	- Sets the terms of an exchange
	- Impose or threaten to impose costs on others
- In capitalism, private property **confers power to its owners**:
	- Employers have power over workers
	- Monopolists have power over consumers
	- Lenders have power over borrowers


## Allocation

- The **outcome** of an economic interaction
- Describes:
	- each person's contribution to the project
	- the product of the project
	- the distribution of the product

### Evaluating Efficiency (objective)
- An allocation is **Pareto efficient** if there is *no other allocation* that makes at least one person better off and no person worse off
- Not the best or most fair outcomes

> [!info]
> Pareto law holds that a small group of people always own most wealth

#### Social dilemma

![[Screenshot 2024-11-03 at 6.21.55 PM.png]]

$I$  = Integrated Pest Control
$T$ = Terminator

**Better outcomes** are visualized by the area to the → and ↑ of each point.
If there is no other allocations in the area of an allocation, that **allocation is efficient**.

The only allocation in this chart that is **inefficient** is $(T,T)$.

> A social dilemma is a **Nash equilibrium** that is **Pareto inefficient**.


### Evaluating Fairness (subjective)
- Provides an **incomplete criterion** for comparing economic outcomes
- Helps choose between **multiple efficient** outcomes

#### John Rawls, an American philosopher
- Method of evaluation
	- Fairness applies to **all people**
	- Imagine a **veil of ignorance**, in which you do not know your gender, ethnicity, health, ability, wealth, parents, etc.
	- Made a **judgement** about the fairness of laws, inheritance, gender roles, etc.
- We should support institutions that **maximize the payoffs** for the **worst-off** in the society (*maximin principle*). Called the ***Rawlsian welfare function***.


## Slavery
American plantation owners **extracted economic rents** through:
- Before 1865, slavery allowed, violent **coercion**.
- After 1865, slavery banned, **voluntary** agreement with ex-slaves

### 40 acres and a mule
- After slavery ban, ex-slaves still worked for the same owners, but with a little more compensation (grey line → blue line)
- Proposal to free slaves by **providing ex-slave families** with 40 acres and a mule (worth $100,000 today)
- Would have allowed black Americans to **own lands**
- Didn't actually happen. Lands restored to former slaveowners


## Example (Angela and Bruno)

- Angela is initially the owner of the land
- Bruno takes over the land and is now the landlord
- They play an **ultimatum game** in which:
	- Bruno is the proposer and Angela is the receiver
	- Bruno forces Angela to work and **make her an offer** she is willing to accept
	- Angela and her fellow farmers **increase their claim** on the harvest

### Pareto efficiency curve

![[Screenshot 2024-11-07 at 1.58.25 PM 1.png]]

Is the allocation **efficient** ?
- Every allocation with 16 hours of free time maximizes the surplus and thus efficient
	- Angela works 8 hours, maximizing the surplus at 4.5 bushels.
	- Moving left or right, it will hurt at least one party.
	- $CD$ is the **Pareto efficiency curve** (*contract curve*)
		- MRS of $D$ = MRT of $C$

#### At Point $G$
- Angela would receive an extra 1.5 bushels but Bruno would receive less economic rent.
- However, Angela **doesn't have the power** to extract the extra 1.5
	- Or else Bruno would hire someone else to work
	- Angela can **go on strike** to negotiate more extracts

#### Strike and Negotiation
- If Angela and her fellow farmers go on strike, they can win new allocations

![[Screenshot 2024-11-07 at 2.08.02 PM.png]]

- The new allocation allows Angela to **still get 4.5** but only for 4 hours of work
	- Angela is now on a higher indifference curve
- This is **bad for Bruno** since he only gets $E-F$ instead of $C-D$. This is *less than half* of his original profit
	- Bruno will want to stay on Pareto efficient ($CD$). This will get him to consider new negotiations
- At Pareto efficient, **both parties** earn more.
	- Bruno will negotiate Angela to work 8 hours but she would receive 1.5 more (intersection between $CD$ and $IC_2$)
