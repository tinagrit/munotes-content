A declarative sentence is an **open statement** if:
- contains 1+ variables
- not a [[Connectives and Truth Table#Statements (propositions)|statement]]
	- becomes a statement when "plugged in" (the variables are replaced by certain *allowable choices*) ie. the universe, integers, reals

> $p(x)$:  The number $x+2$ is an even integer.

$p(5)$: $5+2=7$  **false**

$p(6)$: $6+2=8$ **true**

$\lnot p(7)$: **true**

$\lnot p(8)$: **false**


> $q(x,y)$: The numbers $y+2$, $x-y$, $x+2y$ are even integers

$q(5,2)$: **false**

$\lnot q(4,7)$: **true**

Therefore,
- For some $x$, $p(x)$ is **true**
- For some $x,y$, $q(x,y)$ is **true**
- For some $x$, $\lnot p(x)$ is **true**
- For some $x,y$, $\lnot q(x,y)$ is **true**
