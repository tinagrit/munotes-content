Lecture 8 & 9

## Origin of Light
In an **atom**, electrons orbit around the atom's nucleus. The **Bohr Model** describes these electrons as being in different levels of **energy orbitals**.

Electrons on the lowest energy orbital are in a **ground state**, where electrons on higher energy orbitals are in **excited states**. 
Excited state electrons are **less stable**, as they want to return to their ground state.

Electrons are much like **waves**, the higher energy ones have **higher frequency**.

When an excited state electron **transitions** and drops down to a lower state, due to the *Conservation of Energy*, it releases a particle with the energy that it lost.

This released particle is called a **photon**, which is [[1_Lights and Colours#Light as waves|light]].

### Getting electron excited
Therefore, an excited state electron is the source of light. There are two ways to get an electron excited:
- **Photo-excitation**: *provide* the electron with sufficient photon, so that it goes up to an excited state. Inverse of the process described above.
- **Thermal excitation**: higher object temperature causes more **motion / vibration** of the atoms. Moving atoms can *bump* them into excited states, where they would emit light as they come back down.

A **bigger difference** in energy, i.e. higher jumps, result in waves with **higher frequency** ([[1_Lights and Colours#Energy|bluer]]).

A photo-excited electron, for example, from $n=1$ to $n=5$, may do one jump ($5 \to 1$) or **cascade** down several jumps ($5\to 4 \to 2 \to 1$) based on **quantum mechanics**. 


### Hydrogen jumps
For hydrogens, the jump between $n=3\to 2$ is **highly probable**. A red photon $\text{H}\alpha$ is emitted as the brightest line.

The next most probable jump is between $n=4\to 2$. A blue photon $\text{H}\beta$ is emitted.

## Element Fingerprints
Elements have different arrangements of electrons, and their number of orbits. 

Splitting light apart with a **prism** or **diffraction grating**, we can see different elements shine different colours.

We can use the light from space to **identify** elements from **nebulae and galaxies**, by comparing the spectrum with the known fingerprints, without approaching and getting a sample of the element.

Some example of element fingerprints include:

We can also have a coloured background, and black lines, where black lines show the colours that have been **absorbed** by the atoms of the element.

If we put a cloud of gas of an element, for example, Neon, through a **continuous spectrum** (white light), we can see the effects.

> [!tip] Solar Spectrum
> The Solar Spectrum is an **absorption spectrum**. The atoms absorbing the light are at the surface on the Sun, whereas the light originates from the centre of the Sun.
