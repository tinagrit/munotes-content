Lecture 8 & 9

## Blackbody radiation
Radiation that comes from **the glowing of an object** by itself, not reflected or transmitted light.

All objects reflect, transmit, and **emit** radiation.

The Blackbody Spectrum describes the light wavelengths that each temperature emit on its own.

> [!tip] Use Kelvin
> Temperatures must be in Kelvin. Kelvin is Celsius + 273.
> $$K=C+273$$
> At $K=0$, all thermal motion stops. Water freezes at $K=273$ and boils at $K=373$.


### Wien's law
The **peak** wavelength of the radiation depends on the object's **temperature**. ([[1_Lights and Colours#Temperature|hotter things are bluer]]).
- $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ is the peak wavelength in nanometre (nm)
- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin

$$
\lambda_{\text{max}}=\dfrac{3\times 10^{6} \text{ nm K}}{T}
$$
, and therefore, $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ is **inversely** proportionate to $T$
$$
\boxed{ \lambda_{\text{max}} \propto \dfrac{1}{T} }
$$

Higher temperature means smaller wavelength, and vice versa.


### Stefan-Boltzmann law
The **intensity** or **flux** determines how bright the object shines, based on the object's **temperature**. (hotter things are brighter).
- $I$ is the intensity in watts per square meter
- $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin

$$
I=(5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{ W} \text{m}^{-2}\text{k}^{-4})\cdot T^{4}
$$
, and therefore, $I$ is proportionate to the **fourth power** of $T$
$$
\boxed{ I \propto T^{4} }
$$

If the temperature is doubled ($\times 2$), then the intensity is changed by $2^{4}=16$ times.
