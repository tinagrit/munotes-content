Lecture 11

## Absorption lines
Absorption lines [[2_Origin of Light#Element Fingerprints|are observed]] on the **absorption spectrum**. The depth of the lines depends on:
- amount of the element
- density/pressure of the gas
- temperature of the surface

Most stars have very **similar composition** of elements on the surface
- $\approx 75\%$ hydrogen
- $\approx 25\%$ helium
- $1-2 \%$ of other metals

### Optimal temperature

While Hydrogen is prominent in these stars, the [[2_Origin of Light#Hydrogen jumps|brightest line]] $H\alpha$ is not visible. This is due to **the temperature** of these stars.
- If the **gas is too cold**, there is not enough [[2_Origin of Light#Getting electron excited|energetic photon]]
- If the **gas is too hot**, the hydrogen is completely ***ionized***, electron removed from the atom

Different elements have different **optimal temperature** where the electrons can move to the excited states and come back down.

For hydrogen, it is around $10,000 \text{ K}$

### Spectral types
With this information, we can tell the **star's temperature** using its **light spectrum**. The spectral types classify these temperatures.

In the 1880s, *Williamina Fleming* sorted the spectra by the **strength of Hydrogen lines**, where $\text{A}$ is the strongest, then $\text{B}$, $\text{C}$, $\dots$

In the 1890s, *Annie Cannon* took this system and sorted by **temperature** instead. She classified around 200 spectra per hour, and around 400,000 in her career. She was paid a fraction of the salary of a man due to discrimination, and only got appointed at Harvard when she was 75 years old.

The IAU (*International Astronomical Union*) recognized the classification in 1922, only keeping these letters:
$$
\text{O B A F G K M}
$$
where $\text{O}$ is the hottest and $\text{M}$ is the coolest.

A famous mnemonic for this is "***Oh Be A Fine Girl Kiss Me***" or "***Oh Boy, An F Grade Killed Me***"

Each of the $\text{OBAFGKM}$ is divided into 10 subtypes, labelled $0-9$, where $0$ is hotter than $9$. 

> [!tip] The Sun (solar spectrum) is of type $\text{G2}$.
