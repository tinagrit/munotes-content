## Doppler Effect
A **moving** object that emits wave will appear to have:
- **shorter** frequency in the **front** of the motion (*towards you*)
- **longer** frequency **behind** the motion (*away from you*)

For example, an object that makes **sound waves**, like sirens, as it moves away, the frequency of the sound wave is shorter in front of the motion

Since [[1_Lights and Colours#Light as waves|light is a wave]], we can then use the [[2_Origin of Light#Element Fingerprints|spectral lines]] to determine the speed that an object is moving.

If the star is moving, ***all the light*** shift to longer or shorter wavelengths.

### Redshift and blueshift
If the star is moving *away from us*, the entire spectrum will **shift to the right** (red) due to its wave having longer wavelength.

The **redshift** ($z$) is the factor change in wavelength
$$
z=\dfrac{\lambda_{\text{observed}}-\lambda_{\text{stationary}}}{\lambda_{\text{stationary}}}
$$
![[chart32A 1.png|250]]

The speed that the object is moving can be calculated by:
$$
\boxed{ z=\dfrac{v}{c} }
$$
where $c$ is the [[2_Scientific Notation#Speed of light|speed of light]].

Since $z\propto v$, **bigger shift** means **faster speed**

> [!tip] Hydrogen $H\alpha$
> The [[2_Origin of Light#Hydrogen jumps|wavelength of H alpha]] is 656 nm. If the wavelength is observed to be **just 1 nm longer**, the object would be moving at:
> $$\dfrac{657-656}{656}=\dfrac{v}{3\times 10^{8}}$$
> $$v=457,317\text{ m/s}$$
