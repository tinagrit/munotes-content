Lecture 4

## The Seasons
- Earth's axis of rotation is **tilted** $23.5^{\circ}$ relative to the plane that it orbits around the Sun
	- The tilt stays all year long
	- Different parts of the Earth get **more Sun exposure** at different times of the year
- The **heat** that Earth receives from the Sun depends on:
	- how **high** the Sun is in the sky
	- how **long** the Sun stays in the sky for

> [!warning] Note
> - If the Earth's axis was not tilted, we would **not** have seasons
> - The seasons are not related to the Earth being closer or farther from the Sun (the Earth is closer to the Sun in January)
