## Eclipses
- **Solar Eclipse** - when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth
- **Lunar Eclipse** - when the Moon enters the shadow of the Earth

There aren't eclipses every month (the moon fully orbits earth every month), since the moon's orbit is **tilted** $5.2^{\circ}$, and that tilt is enough to avoid an eclipse.

> [!tip] There are at least 2 lunar and solar eclipses every year, somewhere on Earth.

## Solar eclipses
The moon is right between the Sun and Earth, blocking the Earth from the sunlight of the Sun.

Recall the [[2_Phases of the Moon#Phases of the Moon|Phases of the Moon]], the Moon is only between the Sun and Earth, if it's **a New Moon**.

### Shadow of the moon
Notice that when an object is high off the ground, the shadow will **have a blurry edge**, and so is the moon's shadow.

When the Moon blocks off sunlight (solar eclipse),
- the dark part of the shadow is called the **umbra**
- the blurry edges of the shadow is called the **penumbra**

Observers in the umbra will see a **total solar eclipse**, while in the penumbra will see a **partial solar eclipse**.

Partial solar eclipse is when the Sun is **only partially covered**.

### Moon's elliptically 
The Moon's orbit is **slightly elliptical**, e.g., not a perfect circle.

The moon can **appear bigger** by $\approx 12\%$ when it's closest to Earth. The point where:
- The Moon is closest to Earth is called the **perigee**
- The Moon is farthest from Earth is called the **apogee**

While in the antumbra, the observer could see the **annular solar eclipse**, if the moon is too small to cover the Sun.

> [!tip] Don't confuse **annular** eclipse with **partial** eclipse
> - **Annular** eclipse, we are in the **antumbra** of the moon, it covers the Sun, but is too small to fully cover
> - **Partial** eclipse, we are in the **penumbra** of the moon, it partially covers the Sun, doesn't align with it
>

### Experiencing Total Solar Eclipse
The sky **darkens slowly** during the penumbral phase, and as the umbra approaches quickly, the sky rapidly darkens.

During totality:
- The planets and some stars are visible
- Animals behave like it's night time
- The solar corona becomes visible
- Near the horizon, there is a little bit of light 

> [!tip] A solar eclipse only lasts about 2 minutes.

## Lunar eclipses
The Earth is right between the Sun and Moon, blocking the Moon from the sunlight of the Sun.

Since the Earth is **much bigger** than the moon, the Earth's umbra is wider and longer, and lunar eclipses are **way easier to see**.

> [!tip] A lunar eclipse can last up to 2 hours, and can be seen from anywhere on the dark side of the Earth.

![[chart20A.png|600]]

A total solar eclipse can happen when the Moon is in **either apogee or perigee**, due to the larger size of Earth.

Recall the [[2_Phases of the Moon#Phases of the Moon|Phases of the Moon]], the Moon is only on the other side of Earth, if it's **a Full Moon**.

### Red moon
Lunar eclipses turn red because of the **atmosphere of the Earth**, which bends red light towards its shadow.
