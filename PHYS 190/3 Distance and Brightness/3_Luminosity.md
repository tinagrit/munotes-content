## Luminosity

While [[2_Stellar Brightness#Stellar Brightness|brightness]] refers to how bright an object **appears to be**, (relative to the observer's distance), 

Luminosity refers to the **amount of energy** emitted by the object, per second
- *intrinsic*, natural
- does not depend on distance

When the observer's eyes get farther away from the light source, it appears dimmer, but the light source's luminosity **does not decrease**.

Brightness decrease with the **square of distance**. ($d^{2}$)
If the Sun were 3 times farther away, it would be 9 times dimmer.
$$
\boxed{ b \propto \dfrac{1}{d^{2}} } \implies b=C \dfrac{1}{d^{2}}\text{ where }C \in \mathbb{R}
$$
The brightness and distance form an **inverse relationship**.

Comparing two stars, we have:
$$
\begin{align}
b_{A}=C \dfrac{1}{d_{A}^{2}} &  & b_{B}=C \dfrac{1}{d_{B}^{2}}
\end{align}
$$
$$
\dfrac{b_{A}}{b_{B}}=\dfrac{\frac{C}{d_{A}^{2}}}{\frac{C}{d_{B}^{2}}}
$$
$$
\boxed{ \dfrac{b_{A}}{b_{B}}=\dfrac{d_{B}^{2}}{d_{A}^{2}} }
$$


### Absolute magnitude
Compared to the [[2_Stellar Brightness#Apparent magnitude|apparent magnitude]], the absolute magnitude is the brightness magnitude of an object if it were $10$ [[1_Parallax#Parsec|parsec]] away from Earth.

Each magnitude is a factor of around $2.5$ in **luminosity**. Therefore:
$$
\dfrac{L_{2}}{L_{1}}=2.5^{M_{1}-M_{2}}
$$
where $\frac{L_{2}}{L_{1}}$ is the **ratio of luminosity** of stars 1 and 2, and $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are the **absolute magnitudes** of stars 1 and 2.

Luminosity is often compared to the luminosity **of the Sun**, referred to as ***Solar luminosity***.
$$
L_{\odot}=4.8\text{ absolute magnitude}
$$
The luminosity of a star is written **in terms of** $L_{\odot}$.
