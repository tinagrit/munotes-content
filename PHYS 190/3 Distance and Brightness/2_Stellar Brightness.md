## Stellar Brightness
The ancient *Greeks* divided the stars into **6 magnitudes** based on brightness
- First mentioned by *Ptolemy*, but believed to be invented by *Hipparchus*
- The **lower** the magnitude, the **brighter** the star
- System still in use today, formalized in 1856 by *Norman Pogson*

The duration between sunset and end of twilight was **divided into 6** intervals. The brighter stars (1st magnitude) appear first, then dimmer stars (6th magnitude) appear later.

With precise measurements nowadays, measurements can go below 0 for bright stars.
$$
\begin{align}
\downarrow\text{ magnitude} &  & \uparrow\text{ brightness}
\end{align}
$$

> [!warning] The dimmest star that a human eye can see is magnitude $\approx 6$

Each magnitude is a factor of around $2.5$ in brightness. Therefore,
- Magnitude 2 is $2.5\text{x}$ brighter than magnitude 1
- Magnitude 3 is $2.5^{2}=6.25\text{x}$ brighter than magnitude 1
- Magnitude 6 is $\approx 100\text{x}$ brighter than magnitude 1

In general:
$$
\dfrac{b_{2}}{b_{1}}=2.5^{m_{1}-m_{2}}
$$
where $\frac{b_{2}}{b_{1}}$ is the **ratio of brightness** of stars 1 and 2, and $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are the **magnitudes** of stars 1 and 2.



> For example, *Betelgeuse* (star 1) is $0.8$ in magnitude, and *Sirius* (star 2) is $-1.5$ in magnitude.  

Substituting:
$$
\dfrac{b_{2}}{b_{1}}=2.5^{0.8-(-1.5)}
$$
$$
\dfrac{b_{2}}{b_{1}}\approx 8.227
$$
This means that *Sirius* is $8.227\text{x}$ brighter than *Betelgeuse*.


### Brightness values
- The brightest star seen from Earth is the Sun, at $-26.78$ magnitude
- The second brightest is *Sirius*, at $-1.5$ magnitude

We can also measure non-stars that are bright in the sky as well:
- The moon is $-12.7$ magnitude
- Jupiter is $-2.94$ magnitude
- Saturn is $-0.55$ magnitude
