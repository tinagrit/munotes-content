- sees edges of the **observable universe**
	- ~13 billion light years (light year = 10 trillion km)
	- 10,000 galaxies
- **Extrapolating** the observable universe to the entire universe, there are more than a **trillion galaxies** in the universe
- Each galaxy consists of 10-100 billion stars, totalling ~$10^{23}$ stars in the universe.
