## Eclipses
- **Solar Eclipse** - when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth
- **Lunar Eclipse** - when the Moon enters the shadow of the Earth

There aren't eclipses every month (the moon fully orbits earth every month), since the moon's orbit is **tilted** $5.2^{\circ}$, and that tilt is enough to avoid an eclipse.

> [!tip] There are at least 2 lunar and solar eclipses every year, somewhere on Earth.

## Solar eclipses
The moon is right between the Sun and Earth, blocking the Earth from the sunlight of the Sun.

### Shadow of the moon
Notice that when an object is high off the ground, the shadow will **have a blurry edge**, and so is the moon's shadow.

When the Moon blocks off sunlight (solar eclipse),
- the dark part of the shadow is called the **umbra**
- the blurry edges of the shadow is called the **penumbra**

Observers in the umbra will see a **total solar eclipse**, while in the penumbra will see a **partial solar eclipse**.

### Moon's elliptically 
The Moon's orbit is **slightly elliptical**, e.g., not a perfect circle.

The moon can **appear bigger** by $\approx 12\%$ when it's closest to Earth. The point where:
- The Moon is closest to Earth is called the **perigee**
- The Moon is farthest from Earth is called the **apogee**

While in the umbra, the observer could see the **annular solar eclipse**, if the moon is too small to cover the Sun.

### Experiencing Total Solar Eclipse
The sky **darkens slowly** during the penumbral phase, and as the umbra approaches quickly, the sky rapidly darkens.

During totality:
- The planets and some stars are visible
- Animals behave like it's night time
- The solar corona becomes visible
- Near the horizon, there is a little bit of light 

> [!tip] A solar eclipse only lasts about 2 minutes.

## Lunar eclipses
The Earth is right between the Sun and Moon, blocking the Moon from the sunlight of the Sun.

Since the Earth is **much bigger** than the moon, the Earth's umbra is wider and longer, and lunar eclipses are **way easier to see**.

> [!tip] A lunar eclipse can last up to 2 hours, and can be seen from anywhere on the dark side of the Earth.

### Red moon
Lunar eclipses turn red because of the **atmosphere of the Earth**, which bends red light towards its shadow.
