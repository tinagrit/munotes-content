## View dependency
The view of the night sky depends on:
- [[#Where you are on Earth|Where you are on Earth]]
- [[#Time of the night|Time of the night]]
- [[#Time of the year|Time of the year]]

---
### Where you are on Earth
- We can see **half of the sphere** anywhere on Earth, since above the horizon is a hemisphere (semi-sphere)
	- Completely different constellations are seen on different parts of the world, an evidence that **the Earth is round**
	- This allows us to use the *Polaris* to [[4_Coordinates#Finding latitude|find the latitude]] on the Northern hemisphere

### Time of the night
- Stars **rise in the East** and **set in the West**, just like the Sun
	- Some stars are never seen (e.g. the Southern Cross in the Northern Hemisphere)
	- Some stars are always seen; **circumpolar** (e.g. the Big Dipper in the Northern Hemisphere)
- Stars **move at an angle**, based on the latitude
	- This is due to the Earth's axis of rotation
	- For example, at $49^{\circ} \text{ N}$ (Vancouver), if the observer is:
		- looking East, stars will appear to be rising ($\nearrow$)
		- looking West, stars will appear to be setting ($\searrow$)
		- looking South, stars will rise from the left, reach its highest point, then set on the right ($\nearrow\searrow$)
		- looking North, stars will spin counter clockwise around the *Polaris*
	- The direction will be opposite for an observer in the Southern hemisphere. Two celestial poles are also a strong evidence that **the Earth is round**

### Time of the year
- The apparent **path** of the Sun in the sky is called the "**ecliptic**"
	- All the planets in the Solar System are also on the ecliptic, since they all orbit the Sun
	- Many *Zodiac* constellations are on the ecliptic (where the Sun goes through)
- **Revolution** of the Earth around the Sun is why we see different constellations at different times of the year
