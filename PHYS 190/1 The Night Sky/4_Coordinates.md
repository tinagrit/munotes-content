Lecture 3 & 4

## Terrestrial Coordinates
- The **latitude** is the horizontal line (goes from west-east) to measure how much north or south we are from the equator
	- The equator is $0^{\circ}$ latitude
	- The north pole is $90^{\circ} \text{ N}$ latitude
	- The south pole is $90^{\circ}\text{ S}$ latitude
- The **longitude** is the vertical line (goes from north-south) to measure how much east or west we are from the *Prime Meridian* in Greenwich, England
	- The Prime Meridian is $0^{\circ}$ longitude
	- Values extend to $180^{\circ}\text{ E}$ and $180^{\circ} \text{ W}$

### Finding latitude
- The **North Star** (*Polaris*) is very close to the **North celestial pole**. Since Earth rotates on its axis, this star never moves.
	- *Polaris* is on the **horizon** at latitude $0^{\circ}$. As one moves north from the equator, the *Polaris* rises as much as the latitude north
	- *Polaris* is then on the **zenith** at latitude $90^{\circ} \text{ N}$

> [!tip] The Polaris is only visible in the Northern Hemisphere
> We can measure the current latitude by measuring the angle that the *Polaris* is above the horizon.

- The **Southern Cross** points to the **South celestial pole**. The centre of the cross does not move.
	- We can use the same method as the *Polaris* to determine the latitude south

### Finding longitude
- Since stars spin around the Celestial Sphere, we cannot use them to reliably determine the longitude
- **Clocks** are calibrated to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time; at the *Prime Meridian*) when a ball at the Greenwich Observatory drops at 1 PM GMT.
	- Whenever the Sun is highest up the sky, it is **noon local time**
	- Compare this to the GMT
	- For example, if it is noon local time and 3 PM GMT, then local time is 3 hours behind, or $\dfrac{1}{8}$ of a day behind. This means that the longitude we are at is $\dfrac{1}{8}$ of the globe west of Greenwich. $360^{\circ}\times \dfrac{1}{8}=45^{\circ} \text{ W}$

## Celestial Coordinates
We can use the Terrestrial Coordinates to **project** on to the [[3_Celestial Sphere#The Celestial Sphere|Celestial Sphere]].
- The **declination** (Dec) is the latitude
	- Measured in [[3_Celestial Sphere#Angular size|degrees, arc-minutes, and arc-seconds]], like the latitude
	- The celestial equator is $0^{\circ}0'0''$
- The **right ascension** (RA) is the longitude
	- Measured in hours, minutes, and seconds
		- $24$ hours RA = $360^{\circ}$
		- $1$ hour RA = $\dfrac{360^{\circ}}{24}=15^{\circ}$
		- $1$ minute RA = $\dfrac{1}{4}^{\circ}$
	- RA = $0\text{h}$ set at the Sun's position at **Spring/Vernal Equinox** (~21st of March)
