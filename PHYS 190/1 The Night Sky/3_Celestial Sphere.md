Lecture 2 & 3

## The Celestial Sphere
- The **imaginary** sphere around us on which the stars appear to reside
- Stars being so far away from Earth, it looks as if they are dots on the sphere going around Earth
- We can **notice stars move** by observing the night sky for a few hours

While standing up straight:
- The point directly above the head is the **Zenith**, independent on one's perspective
- 90 degrees from the Zenith is the **horizon**, goes all the way around (where the sky touches the Earth)

In the Earth's perspective:
- Where the Earth's north pole point towards the **North celestial pole**
- Where the Earth's south pole points towards the **South celestial pole**
- The circle in the sky directly above the Earth's equator is the **Celestial equator**

The sky appears to spin in our perspective, due to the Earth's rotation.

## Angular size
We can roughly measure the size of objects in the celestial spheres using **its relative angle** from us.

For example, measuring the top to the bottom of the moon will be around $0.5^{\circ}$

If we extend our arm out,
- One pinky finger is $\approx 1^{\circ}$
- Three fingers are $\approx 5^{\circ}$
- A fist is $\approx 10^{\circ}$
- A hand is $\approx 20 ^{\circ}$

This means that a moon could look big, but at arm's length, it should still be $\approx$ half the width of a pinky finger.

Since objects are usually **very small** in terms of degrees, a unit of degree is divided into:
- $1^{\circ}=60'$ (**arc-minutes**)
- $1'=60''$ (**arc-seconds**)

Therefore,
- one degree $1^{\circ}=60'=3,600''$
- a full circle is $360^{\circ}=21,600'=1,296,000''$

> [!tip] The human eye resolution limit is around $1'$

Some objects:
- The moon $=0.5^{\circ}=30'$
- The sun $=30'$ (same size as the moon, due to its distance)
- The Andromeda Galaxy $=3^{\circ}$
- Jupiter and Saturn (including rings) $=40''$
