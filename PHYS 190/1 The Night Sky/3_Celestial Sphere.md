## The Celestial Sphere
- The **imaginary** sphere around us on which the stars appear to reside
- Stars being so far away from Earth, it looks as if they are dots on the sphere going around Earth
- We can **notice stars move** by observing the night sky for a few hours

While standing up straight:
- The point directly above the head is the **Zenith**, independent on one's perspective
- 90 degrees from the Zenith is the **horizon**, goes all the way around (where the sky touches the Earth)

In the Earth's perspective:
- Where the Earth's north pole point towards the **North celestial pole**
- Where the Earth's south pole points towards the **South celestial pole**
- The circle in the sky directly above the Earth's equator is the **Celestial equator**

The sky appears to spin in our perspective, due to the Earth's rotation.
