## Phases of the Moon
- Moonlight is **reflected sunlight**
- As the moon orbits the Earth, the illumination changes, resulting in phases
	- The moon is always **half-lit** on the Sun's side
	- The observer on Earth will see the illumination differently based on **where the moon is** relative to Earth
- The orbital period of the moon is $29.5$ days
	- Roughly $3-4$ days between each phase, for 8 phases

The moon starts from the **New Moon** (all dark)
- **Waxing** refers to "getting bigger", brightens from right to left
- **Waning** refers to "getting smaller", darkens from right to left

The outer ring of this image shows what the moon looks like from the Earth's observer perspective.

### Determining the time based on the phase
Using the phase of the moon, we can determine the **angle** between Moon, Sun, and Earth
- The *Waxing Crescent* is $\approx 45^{\circ}$ from the Sun
- The *Full Moon* is $180 ^{\circ}$ from the Sun

Using this angle, we can determine the time that the moon will rise, set, or at the highest point in the sky.

1. **Draw** the Earth, Sun, Moon at the angle as seen from space
2. **Rotate** the entire drawing, to make Earth centred, so that the moon is:
	- on the **left** to find when it rises
	- on the **right** to find when it sets
	- on the **top** to find the highest point
3. **Draw** the ground underneath Earth and turn the Earth into an Earthling
4. **Determine** the position of the Sun to tell the time


> For example, determine the time that a Waxing Crescent moon would rise.

The Waxing Crescent moon is $45^{\circ}$ between the Earth/Sun. We draw the following:

Now, we rotate the drawing such that the moon is to the left and the Earth is centred:

Now, we draw the ground beneath Earth and turn the Earth into an Earthling:

From the final drawing, we can now determine using the sun that **it is around 9-10 AM in the morning** (after sunset, before noon) when the *Waxing Crescent* moon rises.
