Type of the [[1_Forms of Hydrogen#Interstellar Medium|ISM]]
## Ionized Hydrogen (HII)
The ionized hydrogen received a UV photon, enough to [[5_Stellar Absorption#Optimal temperature|ionize]] the one electron.
This is labelled $\text{HII}$ (hydrogen two)

> A star of temperature $> 10,000 \text{ K}$ is needed, "**O stars**", to ionize electrons.

In hot stars, hydrogen electrons get ionized. **Free electrons recombine** with protons after a short time, but ionization is continuous.

As they recombine, electrons **cascade** down the orbitals, resulting [[2_Origin of Light#Hydrogen jumps|one or multiple jumps]]. $H\alpha$ (656 nm) is the most probable jump.

The nebulae images **look pink** due to the red from $H\alpha$ (656 nm), and the cyan from $H\beta$ (486 nm).
