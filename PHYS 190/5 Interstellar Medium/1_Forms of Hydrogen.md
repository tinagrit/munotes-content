## Interstellar Medium
The **object between stars** are referred to as Interstellar Medium (*ISM*)

The types of ISM include:
- Neutral or atomic hydrogen ($\text{HI}$) clouds
- Ionized hydrogen ($\text{HII}$) regions
- Molecular clouds

The roman numeral in the nuclear physics notation refers to the **amount of ionized electron**
- $\text{I}$ means neutral atom
- $\text{II}$ means one electron removed
- $\text{III}$ means two electron removed
- $\dots$
 
### Neutral Hydrogen
The neutral or atomic hydrogen has **1 proton** and **1 electron**. 
This is labelled $\text{HI}$ (hydrogen one)

### Ionized Hydrogen
The ionized hydrogen received a UV photon, enough to [[5_Stellar Absorption#Optimal temperature|ionize]] the one electron.
This is labelled $\text{HII}$ (hydrogen two)

In hot stars, hydrogen electrons get ionized. **Free electrons recombine** with protons after a short time, but ionization is continuous.

As they recombine, electrons **cascade** down the orbitals, resulting [[2_Origin of Light#Hydrogen jumps|one or multiple jumps]]. $H\alpha$ is the most probable jump.

The nebulae images **look pink** due to the red from $H\alpha$, and the cyan from $H\beta$.

### Molecular Hydrogen
Two atomic hydrogen atoms bond together.
This is labelled as $\text{H}_{2}$ (hydrogen sub two)
