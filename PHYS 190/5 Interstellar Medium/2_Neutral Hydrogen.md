Type of the [[1_Forms of Hydrogen#Interstellar Medium|ISM]]
## Neutral Hydrogen (HI)
The neutral or atomic hydrogen has **1 proton** and **1 electron**. 
This is labelled $\text{HI}$ (hydrogen one)

Most hydrogen is of $\text{HI}$. There aren't many **O stars** that can [[3_Ionized Hydrogen#Ionized Hydrogen (HII)|ionize hydrogen electrons]].

The electrons are, therefore, **never excited**, and never drop down energy levels. This is why it is **hard to see** $\text{HI}$ atoms.

### Spin-Flip Transition
Protons and electrons **spin** around an axis. As the electron "**flips**" its spinning orientation, it emits a tiny amount of energy.

A tiny amount of energy results in a **longer wavelength** ([[1_Lights and Colours#Energy|why]]). This results in a $\approx 21\text{ cm}$ wavelength, which corresponds to a radio wave.

While this transition is **very rare** (once in 10 million years), there are [[1_Forms of Hydrogen#Density|many]] ($10^{67}$) Hydrogen atoms, which is why it is common to see in space.

**Radio telescopes** on Earth pick these waves up and create a map of the Milky Way.
