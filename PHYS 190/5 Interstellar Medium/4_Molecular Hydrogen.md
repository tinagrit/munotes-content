Type of the [[1_Forms of Hydrogen#Interstellar Medium|ISM]]
## Molecular Hydrogen
Two atomic hydrogen atoms bond together.
This is labelled as $\text{H}_{2}$ (hydrogen sub two)

### Molecular Clouds
Around $1\%$ of the [[1_Forms of Hydrogen#Interstellar Medium|ISM]] is in the form of these dust grains. Metals form inside stars and **spewed out** during *Stellar Death*. These heavy elements are condensed into grains (~few hundred nm in size) in cold space.

These dust grains **block starlight**, as the absence of UV light allows molecules to form. (UV breaks molecules). 

This leads to the gas being cold ($10-20\text{ K}$), which allows gravity to pull together the molecules into **dense clouds** ($100-1000 \text{ atoms}/\text{cm}^{3}$).
- Most massive and dense clouds are called ***Giant Molecular Clouds*** (**GMCs**)

This high density, low temperature condition is **ideal for star formation**.

> [!tip] $\text{H}_{2}$ detection
> Molecular hydrogen is extremely hard to detect. Detection via [[2_Neutral Hydrogen#Spin-Flip Transition|radio waves]] is difficult due to the gas being too cold. $\text{H}_{2}$ is usually traced through other molecules such as $\text{CO}$ (microwave).
