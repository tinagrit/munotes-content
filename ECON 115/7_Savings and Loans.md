## Savings in a closed economy

Recall the [[2_The GDP#Expenditure approach|GDP Expenditure Formula]]
$$
\text{GDP}=C+I+G+(EX-IM)
$$
In a **closed economy**, the net export is $0$, and:
$$
\text{GDP}=C+I+G
$$
where:
- $C$: the consumer spending
- $I$: the investment spending
- $G$: the government purchases

Meanwhile, in the entire economy, all income goes to
- **Spending**: by the private and public ($C+G$)
- **Savings**: by the private and public ($S_{\text{National}}$)
Therefore, the GDP can also be calculated with
$$
\text{GDP}=C+G+ S_{\text{National}}
$$
Putting the two equations together, we get:
$$
C+I+G=C+G+S_{\text{National}}
$$
$$
 \implies I=S_{\text{National}}
$$

> [!important] The Savings-Investment Spending Identity
> The $I$ (investment spending) $=S$ (savings)

The national savings ($S_{\text{National}}$) is made up of
- [[#Budget balance (Public savings)|Public savings]]
- [[#Private savings|Private savings]]

### Budget balance (Public savings)
- **difference** between tax revenue and government spending
	- **budget surplus** refers to a positive budget balance
	- **budget deficit** refers to a negative budget balance
$$
S_{\text{Public}}=T-TR-G
$$
- where
	- $S_{\text{Public}}$ is the government savings
	- $T$ is the tax revenue
	- $TR$ is government transfer
	- $G$ is government spendings

### Private savings
- **disposable income** after taxes and spendings
- considering that GDP is the [[2_The GDP#Income approach|total income]], subtracting taxes and consumer spending from it will result in private savings
$$
S_{\text{Private}}=\text{GDP}+TR-T-C
$$
- where
	- $TR$ is government transfer (residents receive this)
	- $T$ is the taxes
	- $C$ is the consumer spending

### National savings
- Sum of **private savings** and the **budget balance**
$$
S_{\text{National}}=S_{\text{Private}}+S_{\text{Public}}
$$
- Plugging in the formulae for $S_{\text{Private}}$ and $S_{\text{Public}}$, we get:
$$
S_{\text{National}}=(\text{GDP}+TR-T-C)+(T-TR-G)
$$
$$
S_{\text{National}}=\text{GDP}-C-G
$$
- where
	- $C$ is the consumer spending
	- $G$ is government spendings

We get back the **same equation** that we've seen above 
($\text{GDP}=C+G+ S_{\text{National}}$)

## Savings in an open economy
- money can **flow in and out**
- savings can be spent **outside** the country/economy
- with this, a given country can
	- receive **inflows** of funds
		- money made elsewhere invested into this economy
	- generate **outflows** of funds
		- money made in this economy invested elsewhere


### Net Capital Inflow
- total amount of funds **inflowing** into an economy
$$
NCI=IM-EX
$$
- where
	- $IM$ is the total amount of imports
	- $EX$ is the total amount of exports
- the **Net Foreign Investment** measures the amount of funds outflowing, is the **opposite** of Net Capital Inflow
- Canada's NCI in 2019 was $\$38.9$ billion, meaning that foreigners invested that amount more in Canada than Canadians invested abroad

Referring back to the [[2_The GDP#Expenditure approach|GDP Expenditure]] formula:
$$
\text{GDP}=C+G+I+(EX-IM)
$$
Rearranging, we get:
$$
I=\text{GDP}-C-G+(IM-EX)
$$
From above, we know that 
- $S_{\text{National}}=\text{GDP}-C-G$ 
- $NCI=IM-EX$
Substituting, we get:
$$
I=S_{\text{National}}+NCI
$$
This means that all investment spending is equal to the sum of national savings and funds inflowing into the economy.

> [!important] The Savings-Investment Spending Identity still holds 
> In an open economy, the investment spending is still equal to the total savings. It just has to include savings from **foreign sources**.

## Loanable Funds Market
- outcome of
	- **demand** for funds generated by borrowers 
	- **supply** of funds provided by lenders
- the **price of loans** is the **interest rate**
	- *not accounting for inflation*

### Present Value
 - amount of money **needed today**
 $$
P\times (1+r)=F
$$
- where
	- $P$ is the present value
	- $r$ is the interest rate
	- $F$ is the future value


### Demand and Supply

- As interest rates **decreased**, there is **more demand** for loans
	- less attractive to put money into the bank
- This can be **shifted** by:
	- Changes in perceived business opportunities
		- Shift **↑** for **increases**
			- businesses are more willing to borrow at higher interest rates
		- Shift **↓** for **decreases**
			- businesses are less willing to borrow at higher interest rates
	- Changes in government policies

- As interest rates **increased**, there is **more supply** for loans
	- lenders earn more as the interest rates increase
- This can be **shifted** by:
	- Changes in private savings behaviour
	- Changes in government budget balance

- Putting the two in the same graph, the **equilibrium** is shown

### Global Market
- Capital **flows** from countries with **low interest** rates to countries with **high interest** rates
- Capital flows: 
	- **raise** interest rates where they were low
	- **reduce** interest rates where they were high
	- effectively **equalize** interest rates across countries

### Inflation and Interest
- the **true cost** of borrowing is the **real interest rate**
$$
\text{Real interest}=\text{Nominal rate }-\text{ Inflation rate}
$$
- the real interest usually **remains unchanged** because the Nominal rate is adjusted based on the expected future inflation.
	- this is called the **Fisher effect**
