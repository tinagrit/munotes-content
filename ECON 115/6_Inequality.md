## Measuring Inequality

### Size distributions
- A **quintile** is **20%** of any quantity.
	- A quantile of population is a fifth of the total population
- A **decile** is **10%** of any quantity.
	- A decide of population is a tenth of the total population

### Lorenz curves
- show percentage of **income** and percentage of **population**
- measure how far off is size distribution of income from **perfect equality**
	- **straight line** with slope =1 is the perfect equality

- For example, from this chart:
	- point $(50,20)$ means that 50% of the population has access to 20% of the income

### The Gini coefficient
- calculated using the Lorenz curve
	- total area between perfect equality curve and Lorenz curve
	- $0$ (perfect equality) $\leq$ Gini $\leq$ $1$ (perfect inequality)
- the **higher the Gini**, the higher the inequality
