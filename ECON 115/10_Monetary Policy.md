## Holding Money
- **convenient** for spending
- however, holding cash comes **with a price**
	- yields **no return**
	- gives up any potential interest

### Opportunity cost
- the **trade off** of holding cash vs earning interest
- terms of investment
	- **short-term**: matures in less than 1 year
	- **long-term**: matures many years into the future
		- reflect expected future monetary policy (future economic outlook)
		- higher interest rate than short term, carries **extra risk**
- the **most accessible, most liquid** asset earns **least** interest (cash = zero interest)
	- the **higher** the interest rate, the **higher** the opportunity cost

## Money Demand
Also see [[9_Banking System#Money Supply|Money Supply]]

- relationship between the **quantity of money** demanded and the **interest rate**
- the higher the interest rate, the **more people** putting money in their bank accounts

![[Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 3.20.15 PM.png|350]]

- can be **shifted** by changes in
	- aggregate price level
	- real GDP
	- credit market/banking technology
	- institutions

### The Equilibrium Interest Rate
- where the quantity of money demanded and supplied **intersect**
- when the interest rate is higher or lower than the equilibrium, investors will **drive the rate** back to equilibrium

> [!important] The money supply doesn't depend on the interest rate. It is a vertical line at the quantity available.

### Intervention from Central Bank
- the *Bank of Canada* (see [[9_Banking System#The Central Bank|Central Bank]]) can **set the interest rate** by adjusting the [[9_Banking System#Money Supply|Money Supply]]
	- by **buying/selling** [[9_Banking System#Tools of monetary control|treasury bills]] until the rate reaches the target


![[Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 10.35.39 AM.png]]

The central bank **incentivizes** commercial banks to follow their **policy interest rate** by moving the supply left and right.
- when they **buy** treasury bills, there is **more money supply**, and interest rates **decrease**
- when they **sell** treasury bills, there is **less money supply**, and interest rates **increase**

The central bank uses these policies to achieve an **inflation target**.

## Aggregate Demand and Supply
- relationship between **price level** and **output**
- similar to microeconomic's demand and supply curve for a product, but for **all outputs** in the economy relative to the **price level**

### Aggregate Demand Curve (AD)
- how much output is **demanded** (GDP) per price level
- is **downward sloping**, like other demand curves

![[Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 11.36.16 AM.png|400]]

Recall that GDP (the x-axis) is derived from:
$$
\text{GDP}=C+I+G+(X-IM)
$$
When the **price level** is **high**:
- it reduces the **purchasing power** of households, therefore reducing $C$
- it makes households hold on to money, leading to an increase in **interest rates**, and therefore reducing $C$ and $I$

The aggregate demand curve can be **shifted** by:
- **Expectations**: if consumers and firms are *optimistic*, aggregate demand rises
- **Wealth**: when households are more wealthy, their purchasing power rises and aggregate demand rises
- Other factors, like size of the physical capital, and governmental policies

The policy [[#Intervention from Central Bank|from the Central Bank]] can affect the aggregate demand
- **expansionary policy** 
	- increases aggregate demand
	- increases money supply
	- decreases interest rate
- **contractionary policy** (*tight monetary policy*) 
	- decreases aggregate demand
	- decreases money supply
	- increases interest rate


### Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve (SRAS)
- how much outputs are producers **willing to** **supply** per price level
- is **upward sloping**, higher price level leads to more output supplied 

![[Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 11.59.28 AM.png|400]]

This curve is upward sloping, but only for **short-term** because **wages are sticky**.
- it takes time for wages to change
- when price level rises, companies earn **more profits**
- nominal **wages** are determined by a contract that were sign when the economy was **different**
- aggregate output increases **in the short run**

The short run aggregate supply can be **shifted** by:
- **Commodity prices**: price of commodity (*input bought and sold in bulk*) affects production costs and quantity of output
- **Nominal wages**: affects production costs and quantity of output
- **Productivity**: more productive workers lead to higher quantity of output


### Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve (LRAS)
- how much output is **supplied** if all prices and wages are **flexible**
- prices adjust in the long term
- is a **vertical line** at the actual real GDP, unaffected by the price level

![[Screenshot 2025-04-14 at 12.13.47 PM.png|400]]

It's **not affected** by price level because:
- in the long term, wages are **not sticky**, contracts are renegotiated 
- wages are **adjusted** with the price level, leaving the supply curve unaffected

The [[#Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve (SRAS)|SRAS]] curve will be shifted so that the potential output will **return** to LRAS

### Effects of Monetary Policy

When money supply is **increases** (*i.e. Central bank buys treasury bills*)
- interest rate decreases
- aggregate demand **increases** (*AD shifts right*)
- leads to an increase in output **in the short run** (*upwards along SRAS*)
- eventually, the nominal wages **rises**
- the short run output **decreases** (*SRAS shifts left*)
- intersects at a **new equilibrium**, still along LRAS

Therefore, central bank monetary policy can generate a **positive effect**, only in **the short run**. There is no long run effect.

> [!important] Money is neutral in the long run.
> Changes in the money supply have no real effect on the economy.
