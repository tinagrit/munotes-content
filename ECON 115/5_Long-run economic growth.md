## Economy over time
- Sustained upward trend in the economy's output **over time**
- Reflects one of the basic principles of economics
	- Increases in the economy's **potential** lead to **economic** growth over time
- measured with [[2_The GDP#Nominal and Real GDP|Real GDP]] per capita
	- measures **income** earned
	- isolate the effect of **changes in population**

- Growth rates are **different** across the world ([[#Difference in growth rate|See why]])
	- From 1980, India and China had **higher growth rate** compared to Canada and the US
	- Standard of living in China in 2000 and India in 2012 are **equivalent** to Canada in 1900

- In fact, a **quarter of the world**'s population lives in countries where the standard of living is lower than Canada in 1900

> Economic growth can also **cost** countries as much as it benefits them.
> For example, economic growth in Delhi and Beijing led to **terrible air quality**


### The Rule of 70
- used to calculate how long it takes for Real GDP per capita to **double**
$$
\text{Doubling time}=\dfrac{70}{\text{\% Growth}}
$$
- For example, if real GDP per capita is growing at 3.5%, it will double in:
$$
\text{Doubling time}=\dfrac{70}{3.5}=20 \text{ years}
$$
- growth **compounds**, so it can add up fast

#### Deriving the rule
- $F=Ie^{rt}$ (exponential function) where
	- $F$ is the final value
	- $I$ is the initial value
	- $r$ is the rate of growth
	- $t$ is the time
- Let $F=2I$ (to double)
- $2I=Ie^{rt}$
- $2=e^{rt}$
- $\ln 2=rt$
- $t=\dfrac{\ln 2}{r}$
- $t=\dfrac{\ln 2 \times 100}{r\%}$
- $t\approx \dfrac{70}{r\%}$

### Sources of Growth
- depends on **rising productivity**
- amount of output produced by the average worker (**Labour Productivity**) increases **steadily**
$$
\text{Productivity}=\dfrac{\text{Output}}{\text{Workers}}
$$
- three sources of productivity growth
	- ↑ in **Physical Capital** - buildings and machines
	- ↑ in **Human Capital** - education and knowledge
	- **Technological Progress** - advancements in production


> [!info]
> *Natural resources* are **not as important** than human or physical capital
> - Japan has few natural resources → High GDP
> - Nigeria is resource-rich → Low GDP


## Aggregate Production Function
- **relationship** that shows how the quantity of output is produced using the available factors of production

$$
Y=A\times F(K,L,H)
$$
- where:
	- $Y$: aggregate real output (GDP)
	- $F$: the aggregate production function, consisting of:
		- $K$: amount of physical capital
		- $L$: amount labour
		- $H$: amount human capital
	- $A$: total factor productivity (level of technology)
		- accounts for output not from productive inputs
		- how much technologies magnify the outputs from $K,L,H$

This means that:
- if the amount of physical capital, labour, and human capital **remain the same**
- any rise in output is due to **improvement** in **technologies** ($A$)

![[Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 3.40.57 PM.png|400]]

The aggregate production function:
- exhibits **diminishing return** to physical capital ($K$)
	- if education ($H$) and technology ($A$) are **not improved** (*other things equal*)
	- firms can't keep adding new buildings and machines and expect output to rise by the same ratio
	- can be fixed by advancing education ($H$) and technology ($A$)

## Difference in growth rate
- As [[#Economy over time|mentioned]], growth rates are **different** across the world
- rapidly growing economies are good at:
	- **research and development** (**R&D**)
		- create and implement new technologies
		- scientific advances
		- In 1875, Thomas Edison invented the modern research laboratory
	- **investment** **spending**
		- money for that is from *domestic savings*
		- In 2019, China spent 43% of GDP on investment spending while Canada only spent 22%
	- **education**
		- China's long-run growth can be due to its added human capital

### Government's role
[[1_The Economy#Theory and Policy|Government Policies]] can directly link to economic growth.
- **Subsidies**
	- to *infrastructures*
		- roads, power lines, ports
		- China spends more on this than all of Western Europe and North America combined
	- to *education*
		- `>`90% of Canada's primary and secondary schools are government funded
	- to *R&D*
		- cash refunds and tax credits to businesses that do R&D
- **Functioning Financial System**
	- people *trusting banks* is important to turn money into productive investment spending
- **Protection of Rights**
	- protect innovations, intellectual property rights
	- patents given by government
- **Political Stability**
	- good *laws* and *institutions* that enforce laws
	- good *political system* that maintains those institutions
