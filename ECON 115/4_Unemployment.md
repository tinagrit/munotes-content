Chapter 8

## Unemployment
- Employment
	- people **currently employed,** either full time or part time
- Unemployment
	- people who are actively **looking for work** but arenâ€™t currently employed

### Labour force
- the **sum of employment + unemployment**
- participation rate calculated as the **ratio** of labour force over population
$$
\text{Participation}=\dfrac{\text{Labour force}}{\text{Population aged}>15}\times 100
$$
- the participation shows the percentage of people who are **able** and **looking** for work

### Unemployed workers
1. A **job loser**
	- employment involuntarily terminated
2. A **re-entrant**
	- worked full-time job but has been out of labour force
3. A **job leaver**
	- employment voluntarily terminated
4. A **new entrant**
	- never worked a full-time job for >2 weeks

### Unemployment rate
- the **ratio** of unemployment over labour force
$$
\text{Unemployment rate}=\dfrac{\text{Unemployment}}{\text{Labour force}}\times 100
$$
- Calculated as a ratio of unemployed people to **labour force** (NOT population)
- People are counted if they have been **looking for work for the past 4 weeks**
- Can be **overstated**
	- It takes a few weeks to find a job. The transition is counted as unemployment too.
	- **NEVER** falls to 0
- Can be **understated**
	- People who have given up looking for a job: a **discouraged** worker
		- Discouraged workers are **not included** in the labour force
	- **underemployed** workers work part-time but want to work full time
- doesn't measure the **quality of jobs** or how well people are **matched to their jobs**

### Trends
- unemployment is **higher** for younger workers and near-retirement workers
- Job markets in resource-producing regions like Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba are **sensitive** to commodity prices (oil, wheat)
- recession $\implies$ higher unemployment
- expansions $\implies$ fall in unemployment (not always; jobless recovery)

### Types of Unemployment
- **Natural** unemployment - economy will always have.
	- Frictional
	- Structural
- **Cyclical** unemployment - result of economic changes

#### Frictional unemployment
- time spent due to the time workers **spend searching**
	- matching people to jobs takes time
	- scarcity of information

#### Structural unemployment
- persistent **surplus of job-seekers** in a labour market
	- more workers with a particular skill
	- more workers in a particular geographic region
- happens even when the economy is **at the peak**

#### Cyclical unemployment
- **deviation** of the actual rate of unemployment **from the** **natural** rate
- for example, a recession $\implies$ less construction $\implies$ less construction jobs


## Wages
- the **efficiency wage** is set above the minimum wage to incentivize workers to perform better
	- employees work harder to ensure they aren't fired

### Minimum wage
- government **mandated floor** on wage rate

- Minimum wage is set **above** the equilibrium between labour supply (people looking for jobs) and labour demand (jobs)
- **ALWAYS** leads to **persistent surplus** (*more labour than available jobs*) in the labour market
- **high minimum wage** leads to [[#Structural unemployment]]

#### Unemployment based on Minimum wage
For example, in this situation:

- At $W_{\text{min}}$ (minimum wage), there are $Q_{\text{s}}$ people looking for work but only $Q_{\text{d}}$ jobs.
- This means there are  roughly $Q_{\text{d}}$ people **employed** and $Q_{\text{s}}-Q_{\text{d}}$ people **unemployed**, as shown graphically:

### Labour Unions
- association of workers that **bargain** with employers
- wages, benefits, and working conditions
- can act to:
	- increase wages
	- make it hard to fire full-time works
