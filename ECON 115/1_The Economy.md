Chapter 6

## Macroeconomics
- Focuses on **behaviour of the economy** as a whole
- Focuses on **decisions** made by individuals and firms
- Examines the **actions** of all the individuals and all the firms in the economy

### Example
- **MICRO**: What determines whether *RBC* opens a new office in Shanghai?
- **MACRO**: What determines the *overall* trade in goods, services, and financial assets between Canada and the rest of the world?

## Health of the Economy

### Concerned with:
- [[5_Long-run economic growth|Long-run]] **economic growth**
- [[#The Business Cycle (short-run)|Short-run]] **fluctuations in output and employment** that make up the business cycle

### Focus on:
- Real **GDP** (see [[2_The GDP|The GDP]])
	- Value of final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a given time period
	- Values of GDP can be *misleading*
		- For example, increasing the number of items produced increases the total output, but **so does** increasing the price of each item.
		- *Real* GDP only accounts for real prices for each item.
- **Unemployment**
	- Failure of economy to fully employ its labour force
- **Inflation**
	- Increase in the overall level of prices

### GDP per person
- Average income per person (GDP/person) **varies massively** from country to country
- Best seen by comparing the average income per person:
	- Richest countries, like Switzerland ($70,989)
	- Poorest countries, like Burundi ($783)
	- Switzerland is **90x larger** than Burundi
- *China* produces a lot, but their **population growth rate** is *higher*.
	- This is why it is also important to look at GDP per person vs. GDP overall

### Theory and Policy
- **Pre 1930s economics**
	- *Self-regulating* economics.
	- Unemployment corrected through the working of the *invisible hand*
	- Government interventions made things worse
	- In 1929 (Great Depression), there was no government intervention
		- Economy **didn't get better** after a long time (see chart)
- **Post 1930s Keynesian economics**
	- *Depressed economy* result of *Inadequate spending*
	- Government intervention can help that by:
		- **Monetary** policy: changing interest rates
		- **Fiscal** policy: changing taxes and government spending
	- In 2008 (Great Recession), government **intervened**
		- Slashed interest rates, increased spending, cut taxes
		- Avoided a global economic catastrophe; things **improved much more quickly** (see chart)

> *John Maynard Keynes* established the idea that managing the economy is a **government responsibility**.

## The Business Cycle (short-run)

![[Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 3.46.31 PM.png|400]]

The *Business Cycle* is the short-run alternation between **recessions** and **expansions**.

### Recessions
or *contractions* (see 1990s, 2000s, 2009, 2020)
- periods of economic downturn when **output and employment are falling**
- A *business-cycle **trough*** is the point at which the economy turns from:
	- recession → expansion
- cause many people to **lose their jobs**
- reduces the standard of living, increase **poverty**, cut corporate profits, result in small businesses **bankruptcies**

### Expansions
or *recoveries* (see 1991, 2010, etc.)
- periods of economic upturn when **output and employment are rising**
- A *business-cycle **peak*** is the point at which the economy turns from:
	- expansion → recession

## Trade imbalances

- Canada imports and exports goods and services to the *rest of the world*, making it an **open economy**.
- Trade **surplus** - value of $\text{Exports} > \text{Imports}$
- Trade **deficit** - value of $\text{Imports} > \text{Exports}$
- $\therefore$ if $\text{Exports}-\text{Imports}$ is positive, there is a trade surplus.

- The US and Canada both have trade deficits
