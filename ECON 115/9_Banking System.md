Chapter 14

## Money
- any asset that can **easily be used** to purchase goods and services
	- cash $=$ money
	- [[8_Financial System#Financial Assets|stocks, bonds]] $\neq$ money
- currency **in circulation** refers to all cash held by the public
- must function as:
	- a medium of **exchange**
	- a store of **value**
	- a unit of **account**

### Money Supply
- **total** value of [[8_Financial System#Financial Assets|financial assets]] in the economy that are money
- can include:
	- $M_{1}$, ***most* *liquid*** assets:
		- currency in circulation (roughly 8% of $M_{1}$)
		- chequable bank deposits
	- $M_{2}$, ***near money*** assets: 
		- can *readily* be converted to liquid assets
		- savings account deposits
- the **monetary aggregate** $M$ refers to the overall measure of money supply
$$
M=M_{1}+M_{2}
$$
### Monetary Base
- **sum of** currency in circulation and bank reserves
- different from [[#Money Supply]] since:
	- it doesn't include reserves

### Money Multiplier
- ratio of **money supply** to **monetary base**
$$
\text{Money Multiplier}=\dfrac{\text{Money Supply}}{\text{Monetary Base}}
$$

## Banks
- a financial intermediary that **provides** liquid assets to **lenders** and uses those funds to **finance** the illiquid investment spending needs
- a **deposit** is a claim on the bank that obliges it to give the money back when demanded
- a **reserve** is the currency that banks hold in their vaults and their deposits at the Bank of Canada
- the **reserve ratio** is the fraction of bank deposits that a bank holds as reserves
$$
\text{Reserve Ratio}=\dfrac{\text{Bank Reserves}}{\text{Bank Deposits}}
$$

> [!warning] There is no minimum reserve ratio for banks. They maintain ratios appropriate to avoid running out of cash.

### Bank runs
- when many depositors (*bank customers*) **withdraw their funds** due to fear of a bank failure üò® üè¶ 
- bank doesn't hold all of the deposits
	- they **only reserve some** (*reserve ratio*)
	- and lend the rest
- banks can ***run out of cash*** when a bank run happens

### Bank regulations
- banks are **supervised** by the *Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions* (*OSFI*)

#### Deposit Insurance
- banks in Canada are members of the *Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation* (*CDIC*)
- the *Corporation* **guarantees** that depositors are paid (up to $100,000) even **if the bank fails**

#### Capital Requirements
- requires that **owners of banks** hold more assets than deposits
$$
\text{Assets}=\text{Liabilities}+\text{Equity}
$$
- the bank deposits are **liabilities** of the bank; therefore, to maintain a positive equity, they need to have **more assets**

#### Reserve ratios
- as mentioned above, there is **no minimum** reserve ratios
- there used to be requirements before 1994


### Excess reserves
- a constant $rr$ describing the rate that money multiplies
- **excess reserves** refer to bank's reserves that are above its required reserves
- increase in deposits from $\$1,000$ in excess reserves:
$$
\$1,000+[\$1,000\times (1-rr)]+[$1,000\times (1-rr)^{2}]+\dots
$$
- this is a **geometric series** with $a=\$1,000$ and $r=(1-rr)$
	- the infinite sum is $\dfrac{a}{1-r}=\dfrac{\$1,000}{1-(1-rr)}=\dfrac{\$1,000}{rr}$

## The Central Bank
- **oversees** and **regulates** the banking system
- **controls** the [[#Monetary Base]]
- the *Bank of Canada* acts as:
	- banker for **commercial** banks
	- banker for federal **government**
	- issuer for **currency**
	- conductor for monetary **policy**

### Tools of monetary control
- **reserve ratio** 
	- Canada [[#Banks|doesn't have this policy]]
- **bank interest rate**
- **open-market operations** (See [[10_Monetary Policy#Intervention from Central Bank|intervention from the Central Bank]])
	- the Bank of Canada buys/sells **Treasury Bills** (short term government bonds), but *not* from the federal government
	- if it had bought from the federal government, it would be printing money and trigger inflation
- **government deposit switching**

### Central Bank Structure
- crown corporation owned by the government
- considerable **autonomy**
- the head is a **governor**, appointed for 7 years
- overseen by a *Board of Directors*
	- governor (appointed by the *Board*, not government)
	- senior deputy governor
	- deputy minister of finance (no votes)
	- 12 outside directors
- government can write instructions to the governor if they disagree. **This has never happened**.
