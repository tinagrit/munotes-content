Chapter 7

## National accounts
- The **national accounts**
	- refer to the national income and product amounts
	- **keep track** of the spending
		- consumers, sales of producers, business investment spending, government purchases, and other flows of funds

## Gross Domestic Product
- the market value of goods and services the **economy produces**
- total value of goods and services within a country during a year
- includes:
	- *consumer spending*
		- - **household** spending on goods and services
		- coming from the consumption side
	- *investment spending*
		- spending on **productive** physical capital
		- spending on changes to inventories
	- *government purchases*
		-  total **expenditures** on goods and services by any governments
	- *exports* subtract by *imports*
- Goods and services are **final** if they are sold to the **end user**
	- For example, a *car* is a final product
- Goods and services are **intermediate** if the purchaser is another firm
	- For example, *steel* sold to car factories is an intermediate product
	- included in the GDP calculation depending on the calculation approach [[#Calculating GDP|see below]].

### Calculating GDP
The GDP can be calculated by *either*:
- [[#Value added approach]]
	- adding up total value of **all final** goods and services produced
- [[#Expenditure approach]]
	- adding up **all spending** on domestically produced final goods and services
- [[#Income approach]]
	- adding up **total factor income** earned by households

> [!note] 
> *Adding up all the spending* and *adding up all the incomes* result in the same number
> - One person's spending is another person's income

#### Value added approach
![[Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 2.59.15 PM.png|500]]

Only the **value added** amount goes into the GDP calculation
- This should be the same as the final price to the end user

> [!warning] GDP only includes items that are newly produced and aren't used up

#### Expenditure approach
- widely used by economists
- only count the value of **sales to final buyers** and omit sales between businesses

$$
\text{GDP}=C+I+G+(EX-IM)
$$
- $C$: the consumer spending
- $I$: the investment spending
- $G$: the government purchases
- $EX$: sales to foreigners
- $IM$: imports (purchases of foreign goods)

> [!note] $(EX-IM)$ is the net export


#### Income approach
All incomes within the country are added

- **Factor incomes** include:
	- *wages* earned by workers
	- *interest* paid on savings
	- *rent* earned by those who lease their assets
	- *dividends* paid to shareholders
	- etc.
- **Non-factor incomes** include:
	- income earned by the *federal government*
	- net *indirect taxes*
	- capital *depreciation*, claimed as income tax deductions

#### Canada's GDP

(2019). Calculated using the [[#Expenditure approach]] and [[#Income approach]], yielding the same number.

### Nominal and Real GDP
- The **nominal GDP** represents the **current** price at the time GDP is calculated
	- ↑ in GDP over time can imply ↑ in **prices** instead of in outputs
	- If the cost of an apple changes from $3 → $5, this **increases** **nominal** GDP without producing any more output.
- The **real GDP** adjusts for the changes in prices
	- measures the **aggregate output**, the quantity of final goods and services
	- calculate outputs using a **fixed** price at a time (**base year** in comparison)

> [!important] The nominal and real GDP are the same in the base year

#### The GDP Deflator
- The **ratio** of nominal GDP to real GDP
$$
\dfrac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}} \times 100
$$

#### Example
![[Screenshot 2025-01-13 at 3.34.07 PM.png|500]]

**Calculation**
- The nominal GDP of Year 1:
	- $(2,000 \times \$0.25)+(1,000 \times \$0.50)$
	- $=\$1,000$
- The nominal GDP of Year 2:
	- $(2,200 \times \$0.30)+(1,200 \times \$0.70)$
	- $=\$1,500$
- The real GDP of Year 2 (using Year 1 dollars as base):
	- $(2,200 \times \$0.25)+(1,200 \times \$0.50)$
	- $=\$1,150$

**Analysis**
- The nominal GDP of Year 2 **rose by 50%**
	- this does not take the change in prices into account
- The real GDP **only rose by 15%**.
	- this pegs the prices of apples and oranges to the **dollars of Year 1**
	- represents real change in GDP

### GDP per capita
- average GDP per person
- **not** a one-to-one match to quality of life
	- **Richer** countries *on average* have a **higher well-being**
	- Life satisfaction is **diminishing** compared to GDP
		- As GDP rises, the gain in life satisfaction gets smaller and smaller
	- Sometimes, **middle-income** nations are **more satisfied** with lives
