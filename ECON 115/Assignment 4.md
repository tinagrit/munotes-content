## Question 3

### a)
$M2=$ currency in circulation $+$ checkable deposits $+$ saving deposits $+$ time deposits $+$ money market funds  

- $M2_{2010}=918.8 + 917.9 + 5,331.5 + 934.4 + 686.7=8,789.3$
- $M2_{2016}=1,420.9 + 1,919.0 + 8,814.5 + 353.4 + 691.3=13,199.1$
- $M2_{2018}=1,624.8 + 2,121.7 + 9,260.9 + 532.9 + 811.5=14,351.8$

 $\%$ of circulated currency $=\dfrac{\text{Circulated currency}}{M2}\times 100$
- $\%_{2010}=\dfrac{918.8}{8,789.3} \times 100=10.45\%$
- $\%_{2016}=\dfrac{1,420.9}{13,199.1}\times 100=10.77\%$
- $\%_{2018}=\dfrac{1,624.8}{14,351.8}\times 100=11.32\%$

$M2,2010:\$8,789.3$ Billion -- Circulated currency, percentage of $M2,2010: 10.45\%$
$M2,2016:\$13,199.1$ Billion  -- Circulated currency, percentage of $M2,2016:10.77\%$
$M2,2018:\$14,351.8$ Billion -- Circulated currency, percentage of $M2,2018: 11.32\%$

### b)
**d)** $M2$ increased over time, and currency in circulation as a percentage of $M2$ grows slowly, and stays in the $10-11\%$ range.

## Question 4

### a)
| Assets            | Liabilities                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Reserves $-\$400$ | Checkable deposits $-\$400$ |

**c)** The money supply in unchanged. Currency in circulation increases by $\$400$, but checkable deposits decrease by $\$ 400$.

### b)
Assuming the bank doesn't hold excess reserves, using the formula, we can find out the amount that checkable deposits have to contract.
$$
\Delta \text{ Checkable Deposits}=\dfrac{-\text{ Reserve Shortage}}{rr}=\dfrac{-400}{0.1}=-4,000
$$

The bank has to reduce its checkable deposits by $\$4,000$. However, Ryan's $\$400$ withdrawal already reduced the deposits by that amount. The bank needs to reduce an additional $\$4,000-\$400=\$3,600$ to cover the reserve shortage.

In order to reduce the amount of deposits it holds and satisfy the required reserve ratio, the bank will call in loans by an amount equal to $\$3,600$.

### c)
The $\$400$ went from Ryan's checkable deposit account to currency in circulation, both in the money supply, and therefore not affecting the money supply.

The $\$3,600$ loan that the bank has to call in will be removed from the money supply.

Total money supply contraction: $\$3,600$

### d)
Assuming the bank doesn't hold excess reserves, using the formula, we can find out the amount that checkable deposits have to contract.
$$
\Delta \text{ Checkable Deposits}=\dfrac{-\text{ Reserve Shortage}}{rr}=\dfrac{-400}{0.2}=-2,000
$$

The bank has to reduce its checkable deposits by $\$2,000$. However, Ryan's $\$400$ withdrawal already reduced the deposits by that amount. The bank needs to reduce an additional $\$2,000-\$400=\$1,600$ to cover the reserve shortage.

The $\$1,600$ loan that the bank has to call in will be removed from the money supply.

Total money supply contraction: $\$1,600$

## Question 5

### a)
- $M{1}=$ currency in circulation $+$ checkable bank deposits
- $M{1}=150+500$ (in millions)
- $M{1}=650$

$M{1}:\$650$ million

### b)
- $\text{Monetary base}=$ currency in circulation $+$ bank reserves
- $\text{Monetary base}=150+(100+200)$ (in millions)
- $\text{Monetary base}=450$

Monetary base $:\$450$ million

### c)
By $\text{Reserve Ratio}=\dfrac{\text{Bank Reserves}}{\text{Bank Deposits}}$

- $\text{Reserve Ratio}=\dfrac{100+200}{500}$
- $\text{Reserve Ratio}=\dfrac{300}{500}$
- $\text{Reserve Ratio}=0.6=60\%$

Since the required reserve ratio is $10\%$, way less than the bank's current reserve ratio, the bank is holding **excess reserve**.

**a)** Yes

### d)
By $\text{Reserve Ratio}=\dfrac{\text{Bank Reserves}}{\text{Bank Deposits}}$

Set the reserve ratio to $10\%=0.1$ (absolute minimum reserve ratio) and solve for bank deposits

- $0.1=\dfrac{100+200}{\text{Bank Deposits}}$ (in millions)
- $\text{Bank Deposits}=\dfrac{300}{0.1}$ 
- $\text{Bank Deposits}=3,000$

The current bank deposit is $\$500$ million, while it can have as much as $\$3,000$ million. Therefore, it can increase checkable deposits by $\$3,000-\$500=\$2,500$ million.

Checkable deposit increase: $\$2,500$ million

## Question 6

The money supply includes checkable deposits and not bank reserves. Currently, with a reserve ratio of $10\%$, the commercial banks following this formula:
$$
\text{Reserve Ratio}=\dfrac{\text{Bank Reserves}}{\text{Bank Deposits}}\implies 0.1=\dfrac{100}{1,000}
$$
(in millions)
### a)
If the required reserve ratio falls to $5\%$, the required reserve would become:
$$
0.05=\dfrac{\text{Bank Reserves}}{1,000}\implies \text{Bank Reserves}=50
$$
(in millions)
Therefore, the bank will have an excess reserve of $100-50=\$50$ million. Using the formula, we can find out the increase in checkable deposits.
$$
\Delta \text{ Checkable Deposits}=\dfrac{\text{Excess Reserve}}{rr}=\dfrac{50}{0.05}=1,000
$$

Change in money supply: $\$1,000$ million

### b)
If the required reserve ratio rises to $25\%$, the required reserve would become:
$$
0.25=\dfrac{\text{Bank Reserves}}{1,000}\implies \text{Bank Reserves}=250
$$
(in millions)
Therefore, the bank will have a reserve shortage of $250-100=\$150$ million. Using the formula, we can find out the contraction in checkable deposits.

$$
\Delta \text{ Checkable Deposits}=\dfrac{-\text{ Reserve Shortage}}{rr}=\dfrac{-150}{0.25}=-600
$$

Change in money supply: $\$-600$ million

## Question 7

### a)
| Assets                       | Liabilities                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Treasury bills $-30$ million | Monetary base $-30$ million |

### b)
| Assets                       | Liabilities |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| Treasury bills $+30$ million |             |
| Reserves $-30$ million       |             |

### c)
Since the commercial banks purchased treasury bills using their reserves, their reserves have gone down by $\$30$ million. Assuming they don't hold excess reserves, they now have a reserve shortage of $\$30$ million relative to the $5\%$ reserve ratio. Using the formula, we can find out the contraction in checkable deposits.
$$
\Delta \text{ Checkable Deposits}=\dfrac{-\text{ Reserve Shortage}}{rr}=\dfrac{-30}{0.05}=-600
$$

Total change in money supply$:\$-600$ million
