## Question 1

### a)
- **Argentina 1960**: $\dfrac{5,643}{10,044}\times 100=56\%$
- **Argentina 1980**: $\dfrac{7,908}{10,044}\times 100=79\%$
- **Argentina 2000**: $\dfrac{8,224}{10,044} \times 100=82\%$
- **Argentina 2021**: $\dfrac{\cancel{ 10,044 }}{\cancel{ 10,044 }}\times 100=100\%$

- **South Korea 1960**: $\dfrac{944}{26,762}\times 100=4\%$
- **South Korea 1980**: $\dfrac{3,700}{26,762} \times 100=14\%$
- **South Korea 2000**: $\dfrac{15,105}{26,762}\times 100=56\%$
- **South Korea 2021**: $\dfrac{\cancel{ 26,762 }}{\cancel{ 26,762 }}\times 100=100\%$

### b)
- (b) **South Korea has drastically increased the purchasing power of an average family and real GDP per capita, while Argentina did not have the same success.**

### c)
- (a) **South Korea has achieved higher saving rates, increases in human capital, and adoption of technological advances from other countries, while Argentina has struggled in these areas.**

### c)
From the rule of 70:
$$
\text{Year to double}=\dfrac{70}{\text{\% Growth}}
$$
Since Androde takes 70 years to rise from $50.00$ in real GDP per worker to $100.00$ in real GDP per worker,
$$
70=\dfrac{70}{\text{\% Growth}}
$$
It follows that $\text{\% Growth}=\dfrac{70}{70}=1\%$
$\therefore$ Androde's real GDP per worker grew at $1\%$ per year.

## Question 8

### a)
- **High-income**: $\$42,540\times (1.0073)^{70}=\$70,781$
- **Middle-income**: $\$5,631\times (1.0328)^{70}=\$53,916$

## Question 10

- **Groland**: $\$20,000 \times (1.02)^{100}=\$144,892.92$
- **Stoland**: $\$20,000\times (1.015)^{100}=\$88,640.91$
- In 100 years, Stoland's real per capita GDP will be $\dfrac{88,640.91}{144,892.92}\times 100=61.18\%$ of Groland's
