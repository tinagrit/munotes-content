Chapter 7 and 8

## The Market Basket
- The **aggregate price level** measures the overall level of prices in the economy
- A **market basket** is a hypothetical set of consumer purchases
	- This is used to measure the aggregate price level

For example, when prices of apples, grapes, and peaches increase, the cost of market basket increases.

### Price indexes
- cost to **purchase a market basket** in a given year
- normalized according to a base year
$$
\dfrac{\text{market basket}_{\text{given year}}}{\text{market basket}_{\text{base year}}}\times 100
$$
- the cost of the market basket of a *typical urban family* is called the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**

- *The Canadian CPI*
	- Most of the spending goes to shelter (housing)

- the cost of the market basket *purchased by producers* is called the **Industrial Producer Price Index (IPPI)**


## Level of prices

### Inflation
- an **increase/rise** in the price level
- For example, education has become a lot more expensive (see chart)

- *allegedly* makes everyone *poorer*, but income also often **rises**
- **discourages** people from holding onto cash (and spend)
- The economy **needs** a certain level of inflation to **grow**. It is bad when it is **too high**.
- The **inflation rate** is a % change in price per year, calculated using the [[#Price indexes|CPI]].
$$\text{Inflation rate}=\dfrac{\text{CPI}_{final}-\text{CPI}_{initial}}{\text{CPI}_{initial}}\times 100$$

### Deflation
- A **fall** in the overall level of prices (negative inflation)
- This is **not wanted**. Economists want to see a **stability** in prices (slowly rising over time).
	- This has been achieved since the 1990s to the present.
- Holding onto cash is more attractive than investing
- Can **deepen** a recession

> [!note]
> An economy has **price stability** if the overall price changes slowly. 
> - This is a desirable goal. 
> - It has been achieved since the 1990s.

### Interest rate
- return a **lender receives** for allowing borrowers to use
- borrowing contract specifies **nominal** interest rate
- **real interest rate** refers to nominal interest rate subtracted by inflation
- each party (lender and borrower) have **expectations** on inflation
	- if **inflation > expected**, borrowers gain at the expense of lenders
		- if money is borrowed from the bank at 3% interest rate, but the inflation is 5%, then the bank is losing money
	- if **inflation < expected**, lenders gain at the expense of borrowers
		- if money is borrowed from the bank at 5% interest rate, but the inflation is 3%, then the lender is losing money
