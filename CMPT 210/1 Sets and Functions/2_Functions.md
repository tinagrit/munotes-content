For [[1_Sets#Sets|sets]] $A$, $B$, the function or mapping $f:A\to B$,
- $A$ is called the **domain** of $f$
- $B$ is called the **codomain** of $f$

All elements of $A$ has to **point to somewhere** in $B$ at most once
- Two or more different elements of the codomain cannot be assigned to the same domain
- Passes the vertical line test
- If $f(a)=1$ and $f(a)=2$, then $f$ is not a function

For example, $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x)=x^{2}$

- This function passes the vertical line test
- Draw a vertical line and slide it along the x-axis, nowhere in the graph that the vertical line touches the function more than once

When $a \in A$, $b \in B$, $f(a)=b$,
- "Function $f$ maps $a$ to $b$"
- $b$ is the **value** of $f$ at **argument** $a$
- $b$ is the **image** of $a$
- $a$ is the **preimage** of $b$

### Partial functions
- A **total function** assigns **all elements** in the domain to any codomain
- A **partial function** does not
